# tf.contrib.layers.sequence_input_from_feature_columns

``` python
sequence_input_from_feature_columns(
    *args,
    **kwargs
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/framework/experimental.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/framework/experimental.py).

See the guide: [Layers (contrib) > Feature columns](../../../../../api_guides/python/contrib.layers.md#Feature_columns)

Builds inputs for sequence models from `FeatureColumn`s. (experimental)

THIS FUNCTION IS EXPERIMENTAL. It may change or be removed at any time, and without warning.


See documentation for `input_from_feature_columns`. The following types of
`FeatureColumn` are permitted in `feature_columns`: `_OneHotColumn`,
`_EmbeddingColumn`, `_ScatteredEmbeddingColumn`, `_RealValuedColumn`,
`_DataFrameColumn`. In addition, columns in `feature_columns` may not be
constructed using any of the following: `ScatteredEmbeddingColumn`,
`BucketizedColumn`, `CrossedColumn`.

#### Args:

* <b>`columns_to_tensors`</b>: A mapping from feature column to tensors. 'string' key
    means a base feature (not-transformed). It can have FeatureColumn as a
    key too. That means that FeatureColumn is already transformed by input
    pipeline.
* <b>`feature_columns`</b>: A set containing all the feature columns. All items in the
    set should be instances of classes derived by FeatureColumn.
* <b>`weight_collections`</b>: List of graph collections to which weights are added.
* <b>`trainable`</b>: If `True` also add variables to the graph collection
    `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES` (see tf.Variable).
* <b>`scope`</b>: Optional scope for variable_scope.


#### Returns:

A Tensor which can be consumed by hidden layers in the neural network.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if FeatureColumn cannot be consumed by a neural network.
