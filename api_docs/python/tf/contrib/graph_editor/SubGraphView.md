# tf.contrib.graph_editor.SubGraphView

## Class `SubGraphView`





Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/graph_editor/subgraph.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/graph_editor/subgraph.py).

See the guide: [Graph Editor (contrib) > Module: subgraph](../../../../../api_guides/python/contrib.graph_editor.md#Module_subgraph)

A subgraph view on an existing `tf.Graph`.

An instance of this class is a subgraph view on an existing `tf.Graph`.
"subgraph" means that it can represent part of the whole `tf.Graph`.
"view" means that it only provides a passive observation and do not to act
on the `tf.Graph`. Note that in this documentation, the term "subgraph" is
often used as substitute to "subgraph view".

A subgraph contains:

* a list of input tensors, accessible via the `inputs` property.
* a list of output tensors, accessible via the `outputs` property.
* and the operations in between, accessible via the "ops" property.

An subgraph can be seen as a function F(i0, i1, ...) -> o0, o1, ... It is a
function which takes as input some input tensors and returns as output some
output tensors. The computation that the function performs is encoded in the
operations of the subgraph.

The tensors (input or output) can be of two kinds:

- connected: a connected tensor connects to at least one operation contained
in the subgraph. One example is a subgraph representing a single operation
and its inputs and outputs: all the input and output tensors of the op
are "connected".
- passthrough: a passthrough tensor does not connect to any operation
contained in the subgraph. One example is a subgraph representing a
single tensor: this tensor is passthrough. By default a passthrough tensor is
present both in the input and output tensors of the subgraph. It can however
be remapped to only appear as an input (or output) only.

The input and output tensors can be remapped. For instance, some input tensor
can be omitted. For instance, a subgraph representing an operation with two
inputs can be remapped to only take one input. Note that this does not change
at all the underlying `tf.Graph` (remember, it is a view). It means that
the other input is being ignored, or is being treated as "given".
The analogy with functions can be extended like this: F(x,y) is the original
function. Remapping the inputs from [x, y] to just [x] means that the subgraph
now represent the function F_y(x) (y is "given").

The output tensors can also be remapped. For instance, some output tensor can
be omitted. Other output tensor can be duplicated as well. As mentioned
before, this does not change at all the underlying `tf.Graph`.
The analogy with functions can be extended like this: F(...)->x,y is the
original function. Remapping the outputs from [x, y] to just [y,y] means that
the subgraph now represent the function M(F(...)) where M is the function
M(a,b)->b,b.

It is useful to describe three other kind of tensors:

* internal: an internal tensor is a tensor connecting operations contained
  in the subgraph. One example in the subgraph representing the two
  operations A and B connected sequentially: -> A -> B ->. The middle arrow
  is an internal tensor.
* actual input: an input tensor of the subgraph, regardless of whether it is
  listed in "inputs" or not (masked-out).
* actual output: an output tensor of the subgraph, regardless of whether it is
  listed in "outputs" or not (masked-out).
* hidden input: an actual input which has been masked-out using an
  input remapping. In other word, a hidden input is a non-internal tensor
  not listed as a input tensor and one of whose consumers belongs to
  the subgraph.
* hidden output: a actual output which has been masked-out using an output
  remapping. In other word, a hidden output is a non-internal tensor
  not listed as an output and one of whose generating operations belongs to
  the subgraph.

Here are some useful guarantees about an instance of a SubGraphView:

* the input (or output) tensors are not internal.
* the input (or output) tensors are either "connected" or "passthrough".
* the passthrough tensors are not connected to any of the operation of
the subgraph.

Note that there is no guarantee that an operation in a subgraph contributes
at all to its inputs or outputs. For instance, remapping both the inputs and
outputs to empty lists will produce a subgraph which still contains all the
original operations. However, the remove_unused_ops function can be used to
make a new subgraph view whose operations are connected to at least one of
the input or output tensors.

An instance of this class is meant to be a lightweight object which is not
modified in-place by the user. Rather, the user can create new modified
instances of a given subgraph. In that sense, the class SubGraphView is meant
to be used like an immutable python object.

A common problem when using views is that they can get out-of-sync with the
data they observe (in this case, a `tf.Graph`). This is up to the user to
ensure that this doesn't happen. To keep on the safe side, it is recommended
that the life time of subgraph views are kept very short. One way to achieve
this is to use subgraphs within a "with make_sgv(...) as sgv:" Python context.

To alleviate the out-of-sync problem, some functions are granted the right to
modified subgraph in place. This is typically the case of graph manipulation
functions which, given some subgraphs as arguments, can modify the underlying
`tf.Graph`. Since this modification is likely to render the subgraph view
invalid, those functions can modify the argument in place to reflect the
change. For instance, calling the function swap_inputs(svg0, svg1) will modify
svg0 and svg1 in place to reflect the fact that their inputs have now being
swapped.

<h3 id="connected_outputs"><code>connected_outputs</code></h3>

The connected output tensors of this subgraph view.

<h3 id="graph"><code>graph</code></h3>

The underlying `tf.Graph`.

<h3 id="inputs"><code>inputs</code></h3>

The input tensors of this subgraph view.

<h3 id="ops"><code>ops</code></h3>

The operations in this subgraph view.

<h3 id="outputs"><code>outputs</code></h3>

The output tensors of this subgraph view.

<h3 id="passthroughs"><code>passthroughs</code></h3>

## Methods

<h3 id="__init__"><code>__init__</code></h3>

``` python
__init__(
    inside_ops=(),
    passthrough_ts=()
)
```

Create a subgraph containing the given ops and the "passthrough" tensors.

#### Args:

* <b>`inside_ops`</b>: an object convertible to a list of `tf.Operation`. This list
    defines all the operations in the subgraph.
* <b>`passthrough_ts`</b>: an object convertible to a list of `tf.Tensor`. This list
    define all the "passthrough" tensors. A passthrough tensor is a tensor
    which goes directly from the input of the subgraph to it output, without
    any intermediate operations. All the non passthrough tensors are
    silently ignored.

#### Raises:

* <b>`TypeError`</b>: if inside_ops cannot be converted to a list of `tf.Operation`
    or if `passthrough_ts` cannot be converted to a list of `tf.Tensor`.

<h3 id="__bool__"><code>__bool__</code></h3>

``` python
__bool__()
```

Allows for implicit boolean conversion.

<h3 id="__copy__"><code>__copy__</code></h3>

``` python
__copy__()
```

Create a copy of this subgraph.

Note that this class is a "view", copying it only create another view and
does not copy the underlying part of the `tf.Graph`.

#### Returns:

A new identical instance of the original subgraph view.

<h3 id="__enter__"><code>__enter__</code></h3>

``` python
__enter__()
```

Allow Python context to minimize the life time of a subgraph view.

A subgraph view is meant to be a lightweight and transient object. A short
lifetime will alleviate the "out-of-sync" issue mentioned earlier. For that
reason, a SubGraphView instance can be used within a Python context. For
example:

from tensorflow.contrib import graph_editor as ge
with ge.make_sgv(...) as sgv:
  print(sgv)

#### Returns:

Itself.

<h3 id="__exit__"><code>__exit__</code></h3>

``` python
__exit__(
    exc_type,
    exc_value,
    traceback
)
```



<h3 id="__nonzero__"><code>__nonzero__</code></h3>

``` python
__nonzero__()
```

Allows for implicit boolean conversion.

<h3 id="consumers"><code>consumers</code></h3>

``` python
consumers()
```

A consumer of a subgraph view is a tf.Operation which is a consumer
of one of the output tensors and is not in the subgraph.

#### Returns:

A list of `tf.Operation` which are the consumers of this subgraph view.

<h3 id="copy"><code>copy</code></h3>

``` python
copy()
```

``` python
remap(
    new_input_indices=None,
    new_output_indices=None
)
```

Remap the inputs and outputs of the subgraph.

Note that this is only modifying the view: the underlying tf.Graph is not
affected.

#### Args:
