# tf.contrib.losses.compute_weighted_loss

``` python
compute_weighted_loss(
    losses,
    weights=1.0,
    scope=None
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/losses/python/losses/loss_ops.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/losses/python/losses/loss_ops.py).

See the guide: [Losses (contrib) > Loss operations for use in neural networks.](../../../../../api_guides/python/contrib.losses.md#Loss_operations_for_use_in_neural_networks_)

Computes the weighted loss. (deprecated)

THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed after 2016-12-30.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.losses.compute_weighted_loss instead.

#### Args:

* <b>`losses`</b>: A tensor of size [batch_size, d1, ... dN].
* <b>`weights`</b>: A tensor of size [1] or [batch_size, d1, ... dK] where K < N.
* <b>`scope`</b>: the scope for the operations performed in computing the loss.


#### Returns:

A scalar `Tensor` that returns the weighted loss.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `weights` is `None` or the shape is not compatible with
    `losses`, or if the number of dimensions (rank) of either `losses` or
    `weights` is missing.
