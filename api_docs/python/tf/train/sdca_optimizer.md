Defined in `tensorflow/python/ops/gen_sdca_ops.py`.

Distributed version of Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (SDCA) optimizer for

linear models with L1 + L2 regularization. As global optimization objective is
strongly-convex, the optimizer optimizes the dual objective at each step. The
optimizer applies each update one example at a time. Examples are sampled
uniformly, and the optimizer is learning rate free and enjoys linear convergence
rate.
