# tf.losses.sigmoid_cross_entropy

``` python
sigmoid_cross_entropy(
    multi_class_labels,
    logits,
    weights=1.0,
    label_smoothing=0,
    scope=None,
    loss_collection=tf.GraphKeys.LOSSES,
    reduction=Reduction.SUM_BY_NONZERO_WEIGHTS
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/ops/losses/losses_impl.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/ops/losses/losses_impl.py).

Creates a cross-entropy loss using tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits.

`weights` acts as a coefficient for the loss. If a scalar is provided,
then the loss is simply scaled by the given value. If `weights` is a
tensor of shape `[batch_size]`, then the loss weights apply to each
corresponding sample.

If `label_smoothing` is nonzero, smooth the labels towards 1/2:

    new_multiclass_labels = multiclass_labels * (1 - label_smoothing)
                            + 0.5 * label_smoothing

#### Args:

* <b>`multi_class_labels`</b>: `[batch_size, num_classes]` target integer labels in
    `(0, 1)`.
* <b>`logits`</b>: Float `[batch_size, num_classes]` logits outputs of the network.
* <b>`weights`</b>: Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as
    `labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must
    be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `losses` dimension).
* <b>`label_smoothing`</b>: If greater than `0` then smooth the labels.
* <b>`scope`</b>: The scope for the operations performed in computing the loss.
* <b>`loss_collection`</b>: collection to which the loss will be added.
* <b>`reduction`</b>: Type of reduction to apply to loss.


#### Returns:

Weighted loss `Tensor` of the same type as `logits`. If `reduction` is
`NONE`, this has the same shape as `logits`; otherwise, it is scalar.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If the shape of `logits` doesn't match that of
    `multi_class_labels` or if the shape of `weights` is invalid, or if
    `weights` is None.  Also if `multi_class_labels` or `logits` is None.
