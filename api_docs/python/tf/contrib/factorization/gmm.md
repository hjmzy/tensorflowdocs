# tf.contrib.factorization.gmm

``` python
gmm(
    inp,
    initial_clusters,
    num_clusters,
    random_seed,
    covariance_type=FULL_COVARIANCE,
    params='wmc'
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/factorization/python/ops/gmm_ops.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/factorization/python/ops/gmm_ops.py).

Creates the graph for Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clustering.

#### Args:

* <b>`inp`</b>: An input tensor or list of input tensors
* <b>`initial_clusters`</b>: Specifies the clusters used during
    initialization. Can be a tensor or numpy array, or a function
    that generates the clusters. Can also be "random" to specify
    that clusters should be chosen randomly from input data. Note: type
    is diverse to be consistent with skflow.
* <b>`num_clusters`</b>: number of clusters.
* <b>`random_seed`</b>: Python integer. Seed for PRNG used to initialize centers.
* <b>`covariance_type`</b>: one of "diag", "full".
* <b>`params`</b>: Controls which parameters are updated in the training
    process. Can contain any combination of "w" for weights, "m" for
    means, and "c" for covars.


#### Returns:

* <b>`Note`</b>: tuple of lists returned to be consistent with skflow
  A tuple consisting of:
* <b>`all_scores`</b>: A matrix (or list of matrices) of dimensions (num_input,
    num_clusters) where the value is the distance of an input vector and a
    cluster center.
* <b>`assignments`</b>: A vector (or list of vectors). Each element in the vector
    corresponds to an input row in 'inp' and specifies the cluster id
    corresponding to the input.
* <b>`scores`</b>: Similar to assignments but specifies the distance to the
    assigned cluster instead.
* <b>`training_op`</b>: an op that runs an iteration of training.
* <b>`init_op`</b>: an op that runs the initialization.
