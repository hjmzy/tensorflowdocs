# tf.contrib.gan.losses.wargs.minimax_discriminator_loss

``` python
minimax_discriminator_loss(
    discriminator_real_outputs,
    discriminator_gen_outputs,
    label_smoothing=0.25,
    real_weights=1.0,
    generated_weights=1.0,

)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/gan/python/losses/python/losses_impl.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/gan/python/losses/python/losses_impl.py).

Original minimax discriminator loss for GANs, with label smoothing.

Note that the authors don't recommend using this loss. A more practically
useful loss is `modified_discriminator_loss`.

L = - real_weights * log(sigmoid(D(x)))
    - generated_weights * log(1 - sigmoid(D(G(z))))

See `Generative Adversarial Nets` (https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) for more
details.

#### Args:

* <b>`discriminator_real_outputs`</b>: Discriminator output on real data.
* <b>`discriminator_gen_outputs`</b>: Discriminator output on generated data. Expected
    to be in the range of (-inf, inf).
* <b>`label_smoothing`</b>: The amount of smoothing for positive labels. This technique
    is taken from `Improved Techniques for Training GANs`
    (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498). `0.0` means no smoothing.
* <b>`real_weights`</b>: Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as
    `real_data`, and must be broadcastable to `real_data` (i.e., all
    dimensions must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding
    dimension).
* <b>`generated_weights`</b>: Same as `real_weights`, but for `generated_data`.
* <b>`scope`</b>: The scope for the operations performed in computing the loss.
* <b>`loss_collection`</b>: collection to which this loss will be added.
* <b>`reduction`</b>: A `tf.losses.Reduction` to apply to loss.
* <b>`add_summaries`</b>: Whether or not to add summaries for the loss.


#### Returns:

A loss Tensor. The shape depends on `reduction`.
