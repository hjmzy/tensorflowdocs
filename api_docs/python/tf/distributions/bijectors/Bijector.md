See the guide: [Random variable transformations (contrib) > Bijectors](../../../../../api_guides/python/contrib.distributions.bijectors.md#Bijectors)

Interface for transformations of a `Distribution` sample.

Bijectors can be used to represent any differentiable and injective
(one to one) function defined on an open subset of `R^n`.  Some non-injective
transformations are also supported (see "Non Injective Transforms" below).

#### Mathematical Details

A `Bijector` implements a
[diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism), i.e., a
bijective, differentiable function. A `Bijector` is used by
`TransformedDistribution` but can be generally used for transforming a
`Distribution` generated `Tensor`. A `Bijector` is characterized by three
operations:

1. Forward Evaluation

   Useful for turning one random outcome into another random outcome from a
   different distribution.

2. Inverse Evaluation

   Useful for "reversing" a transformation to compute one probability in
   terms of another.

3. (log o det o Jacobian o inverse)(x)

   "The log of the determinant of the matrix of all first-order partial
   derivatives of the inverse function."
   Useful for inverting a transformation to compute one probability in terms
   of another. Geometrically, the det(Jacobian) is the volume of the
   transformation and is used to scale the probability.

By convention, transformations of random variables are named in terms of the
forward transformation. The forward transformation creates samples, the
inverse is useful for computing probabilities.

#### Example Uses

- Basic properties:

```python
x = ...  # A tensor.
# Evaluate forward transformation.
fwd_x = my_bijector.forward(x)
x == my_bijector.inverse(fwd_x)
x != my_bijector.forward(fwd_x)  # Not equal because x != g(g(x)).
```

- Computing a log-likelihood:

```python
def transformed_log_prob(bijector, log_prob, x):
  return (bijector.inverse_log_det_jacobian(x) +
          log_prob(bijector.inverse(x)))
```

- Transforming a random outcome:

```python
def transformed_sample(bijector, x):
  return bijector.forward(x)
```

#### Example Bijectors

- "Exponential"

  ```none
  Y = g(X) = exp(X)
  X ~ Normal(0, 1)  # Univariate.
  ```

  Implies:

  ```none
    g^{-1}(Y) = log(Y)
    |Jacobian(g^{-1})(y)| = 1 / y
    Y ~ LogNormal(0, 1), i.e.,
    prob(Y=y) = |Jacobian(g^{-1})(y)| * prob(X=g^{-1}(y))
              = (1 / y) Normal(log(y); 0, 1)
  ```

  Here is an example of how one might implement the `Exp` bijector:

  ```python
    class Exp(Bijector):

      def __init__(self, event_ndims=0, validate_args=False, name="exp"):
        super(Exp, self).__init__(
            event_ndims=event_ndims, validate_args=validate_args, name=name)

      def _forward(self, x):
        return math_ops.exp(x)

      def _inverse(self, y):
        return math_ops.log(y)

      def _inverse_log_det_jacobian(self, y):
        return -self._forward_log_det_jacobian(self._inverse(y))

      def _forward_log_det_jacobian(self, x):
        if self.event_ndims is None:
          raise ValueError("Jacobian requires known event_ndims.")
        event_dims = array_ops.shape(x)[-self.event_ndims:]
        return math_ops.reduce_sum(x, axis=event_dims)
    ```

- "Affine"

  ```none
  Y = g(X) = sqrtSigma * X + mu
  X ~ MultivariateNormal(0, I_d)
  ```

  Implies:

  ```none
    g^{-1}(Y) = inv(sqrtSigma) * (Y - mu)
    |Jacobian(g^{-1})(y)| = det(inv(sqrtSigma))
    Y ~ MultivariateNormal(mu, sqrtSigma) , i.e.,
    prob(Y=y) = |Jacobian(g^{-1})(y)| * prob(X=g^{-1}(y))
              = det(sqrtSigma)^(-d) *
                MultivariateNormal(inv(sqrtSigma) * (y - mu); 0, I_d)
    ```

#### Jacobian

The Jacobian is a reduction over event dims. To see this, consider the `Exp`
`Bijector` applied to a `Tensor` which has sample, batch, and event (S, B, E)
shape semantics. Suppose the `Tensor`'s partitioned-shape is `(S=[4], B=[2],
E=[3, 3])`. The shape of the `Tensor` returned by `forward` and `inverse` is
unchanged, i.e., `[4, 2, 3, 3]`.  However the shape returned by
`inverse_log_det_jacobian` is `[4, 2]` because the Jacobian is a reduction
over the event dimensions.

It is sometimes useful to implement the inverse Jacobian as the negative
forward Jacobian. For example,

```python
def _inverse_log_det_jacobian(self, y):
   return -self._forward_log_det_jac(self._inverse(y))  # Note negation.
```

The correctness of this approach can be seen from the following claim.

- Claim:

    Assume `Y = g(X)` is a bijection whose derivative exists and is nonzero
    for its domain, i.e., `dY/dX = d/dX g(X) != 0`. Then:

    ```none
    (log o det o jacobian o g^{-1})(Y) = -(log o det o jacobian o g)(X)
    ```

- Proof:

    From the bijective, nonzero differentiability of `g`, the
    [inverse function theorem](
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function_theorem)
    implies `g^{-1}` is differentiable in the image of `g`.
    Applying the chain rule to `y = g(x) = g(g^{-1}(y))` yields
    `I = g'(g^{-1}(y))*g^{-1}'(y)`.
    The same theorem also implies `g^{-1}'` is non-singular therefore:
    `inv[ g'(g^{-1}(y)) ] = g^{-1}'(y)`.
    The claim follows from [properties of determinant](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Multiplicativity_and_matrix_groups).

Generally its preferable to directly implement the inverse Jacobian. This
should have superior numerical stability and will often share subgraphs with
the `_inverse` implementation.

#### Subclass Requirements

- Subclasses typically implement:

    - `_forward`,
    - `_inverse`,
    - `_inverse_log_det_jacobian`,
    - `_forward_log_det_jacobian` (optional).

  The `_forward_log_det_jacobian` is called when the bijector is inverted via
  the `Invert` bijector. If undefined, a slightly less efficiently
  calculation, `-1 * _inverse_log_det_jacobian`, is used.

  If the bijector changes the shape of the input, you must also implement:

    - _forward_event_shape_tensor,
    - _forward_event_shape (optional),
    - _inverse_event_shape_tensor,
    - _inverse_event_shape (optional).

  By default the event-shape is assumed unchanged from input.

- If the `Bijector`'s use is limited to `TransformedDistribution` (or friends
  like `QuantizedDistribution`) then depending on your use, you may not need
  to implement all of `_forward` and `_inverse` functions.

  Examples:

    1. Sampling (e.g., `sample`) only requires `_forward`.
    2. Probability functions (e.g., `prob`, `cdf`, `survival`) only require
       `_inverse` (and related).
    3. Only calling probability functions on the output of `sample` means
      `_inverse` can be implemented as a cache lookup.

  See "Example Uses" [above] which shows how these functions are used to
  transform a distribution. (Note: `_forward` could theoretically be
  implemented as a cache lookup but this would require controlling the
  underlying sample generation mechanism.)

#### Non Injective Transforms

**WARNING** Handing of non-injective transforms is subject to change.

Non injective maps `g` are supported, provided their domain `D` can be
partitioned into `k` disjoint subsets, `Union{D1, ..., Dk}`, such that,
ignoring sets of measure zero, the restriction of `g` to each subset is a
differentiable bijection onto `g(D)`.  In particular, this imples that for
`y in g(D)`, the set inverse, i.e. `g^{-1}(y) = {x in D : g(x) = y}`, always
contains exactly `k` distinct points.

The property, `_is_injective` is set to `False` to indicate that the bijector
is not injective, yet satisfies the above condition.

The usual bijector API is modified in the case `_is_injective is False` (see
method docstrings for specifics).  Here we show by example the `AbsoluteValue`
bijector.  In this case, the domain `D = (-inf, inf)`, can be partitioned
into `D1 = (-inf, 0)`, `D2 = {0}`, and `D3 = (0, inf)`.  Let `gi` be the
restriction of `g` to `Di`, then both `g1` and `g3` are bijections onto
`(0, inf)`, with `g1^{-1}(y) = -y`, and `g3^{-1}(y) = y`.  We will use
`g1` and `g3` to define bijector methods over `D1` and `D3`.  `D2 = {0}` is
an oddball in that `g2` is one to one, and the derivative is not well defined.
Fortunately, when considering transformations of probability densities
(e.g. in `TransformedDistribution`), sets of measure zero have no effect in
theory, and only a small effect in 32 or 64 bit precision.  For that reason,
we define `inverse(0)` and `inverse_log_det_jacobian(0)` both as `[0, 0]`,
which is convenient and results in a left-semicontinuous pdf.


```python
abs = tf.contrib.distributions.bijectors.AbsoluteValue()

abs.forward(-1.)
==> 1.

abs.forward(1.)
==> 1.

abs.inverse(1.)
==> (-1., 1.)

# The |dX/dY| is constant, == 1.  So Log|dX/dY| == 0.
abs.inverse_log_det_jacobian(1.)
==> (0., 0.)

# Special case handling of 0.
abs.inverse(0.)
==> (0., 0.)

abs.inverse_log_det_jacobian(0.)
==> (0., 0.)
```
