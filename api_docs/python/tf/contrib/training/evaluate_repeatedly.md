Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/training/python/training/evaluation.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/training/python/training/evaluation.py).

Repeatedly searches for a checkpoint in `checkpoint_dir` and evaluates it.

During a single evaluation, the `eval_ops` is run until the session is
interrupted or requested to finish. This is typically requested via a
`tf.contrib.training.StopAfterNEvalsHook` which results in `eval_ops` running
the requested number of times.

Optionally, a user can pass in `final_ops`, a single `Tensor`, a list of
`Tensors` or a dictionary from names to `Tensors`. The `final_ops` is
evaluated a single time after `eval_ops` has finished running and the fetched
values of `final_ops` are returned. If `final_ops` is left as `None`, then
`None` is returned.

One may also consider using a `tf.contrib.training.SummaryAtEndHook` to record
summaries after the `eval_ops` have run. If `eval_ops` is `None`, the
summaries run immediately after the model checkpoint has been restored.

Note that `evaluate_once` creates a local variable used to track the number of
evaluations run via `tf.contrib.training.get_or_create_eval_step`.
Consequently, if a custom local init op is provided via a `scaffold`, the
caller should ensure that the local init op also initializes the eval step.

#### Args:

* <b>`checkpoint_dir`</b>: The directory where checkpoints are stored.
* <b>`master`</b>: The address of the TensorFlow master.
* <b>`scaffold`</b>: An tf.train.Scaffold instance for initializing variables and
    restoring variables. Note that `scaffold.init_fn` is used by the function
    to restore the checkpoint. If you supply a custom init_fn, then it must
    also take care of restoring the model from its checkpoint.
* <b>`eval_ops`</b>: A single `Tensor`, a list of `Tensors` or a dictionary of names
    to `Tensors`, which is run until the session is requested to stop,
    commonly done by a `tf.contrib.training.StopAfterNEvalsHook`.
* <b>`feed_dict`</b>: The feed dictionary to use when executing the `eval_ops`.
* <b>`final_ops`</b>: A single `Tensor`, a list of `Tensors` or a dictionary of names
    to `Tensors`.
* <b>`final_ops_feed_dict`</b>: A feed dictionary to use when evaluating `final_ops`.
* <b>`eval_interval_secs`</b>: The minimum number of seconds between evaluations.
* <b>`hooks`</b>: List of `tf.train.SessionRunHook` callbacks which are run inside the
    evaluation loop.
* <b>`config`</b>: An instance of `tf.ConfigProto` that will be used to
    configure the `Session`. If left as `None`, the default will be used.
* <b>`max_number_of_evaluations`</b>: The maximum times to run the evaluation. If left
    as `None`, then evaluation runs indefinitely.
* <b>`timeout`</b>: The maximum amount of time to wait between checkpoints. If left as
    `None`, then the process will wait indefinitely.
* <b>`timeout_fn`</b>: Optional function to call after a timeout.  If the function
    returns True, then it means that no new checkpoints will be generated and
    the iterator will exit.  The function is called with no arguments.


#### Returns:

The fetched values of `final_ops` or `None` if `final_ops` is `None`.
