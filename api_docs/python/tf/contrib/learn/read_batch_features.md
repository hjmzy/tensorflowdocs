See the guide: [Learn (contrib) > Input processing](../../../../../api_guides/python/contrib.learn.md#Input_processing)

Adds operations to read, queue, batch and parse `Example` protos.

Given file pattern (or list of files), will setup a queue for file names,
read `Example` proto using provided `reader`, use batch queue to create
batches of examples of size `batch_size` and parse example given `features`
specification.

All queue runners are added to the queue runners collection, and may be
started via `start_queue_runners`.

All ops are added to the default graph.

#### Args:

* <b>`file_pattern`</b>: List of files or patterns of file paths containing
      `Example` records. See `tf.gfile.Glob` for pattern rules.
* <b>`batch_size`</b>: An int or scalar `Tensor` specifying the batch size to use.
* <b>`features`</b>: A `dict` mapping feature keys to `FixedLenFeature` or
    `VarLenFeature` values.
* <b>`reader`</b>: A function or class that returns an object with
    `read` method, (filename tensor) -> (example tensor).
* <b>`randomize_input`</b>: Whether the input should be randomized.
* <b>`num_epochs`</b>: Integer specifying the number of times to read through the
    dataset. If None, cycles through the dataset forever. NOTE - If specified,
    creates a variable that must be initialized, so call
    tf.local_variables_initializer() and run the op in a session.
* <b>`queue_capacity`</b>: Capacity for input queue.
* <b>`feature_queue_capacity`</b>: Capacity of the parsed features queue. Set this
    value to a small number, for example 5 if the parsed features are large.
* <b>`reader_num_threads`</b>: The number of threads to read examples. In order to have
    predictable and repeatable order of reading and enqueueing, such as in
    prediction and evaluation mode, `reader_num_threads` should be 1.
* <b>`num_enqueue_threads`</b>: Number of threads to enqueue the parsed example queue.
    Using multiple threads to enqueue the parsed example queue helps maintain
    a full queue when the subsequent computations overall are cheaper than
    parsing. In order to have predictable and repeatable order of reading and
    enqueueing, such as in prediction and evaluation mode,
    `num_enqueue_threads` should be 1.
* <b>`parse_fn`</b>: Parsing function, takes `Example` Tensor returns parsed
    representation. If `None`, no parsing is done.
* <b>`name`</b>: Name of resulting op.
* <b>`read_batch_size`</b>: An int or scalar `Tensor` specifying the number of
    records to read at once. If `None`, defaults to `batch_size`.


#### Returns:

A dict of `Tensor` or `SparseTensor` objects for each in `features`.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: for invalid inputs.
