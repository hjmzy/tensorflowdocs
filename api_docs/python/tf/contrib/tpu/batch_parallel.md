# tf.contrib.tpu.batch_parallel

``` python
batch_parallel(
    computation,
    inputs=None,
    num_shards=1,
    infeed_queue=None,
    global_tpu_id=None,
    name=None
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/tpu/python/tpu/tpu.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/tpu/python/tpu/tpu.py).

Shards `computation` along the batch dimension for parallel execution.

Convenience wrapper around shard().

`inputs` must be a list of Tensors or None (equivalent to an empty
list). Each input is split into `num_shards` pieces along the 0-th
dimension, and computation is applied to each shard in parallel.

Tensors are broadcast to all shards if they are lexically captured by
`computation`. e.g.,

x = tf.constant(7)
def computation():
  return x + 3
... = shard(computation, ...)

The outputs from all shards are concatenated back together along their 0-th
dimension.

Inputs and outputs of the computation must be at least rank-1 Tensors.

#### Args:

* <b>`computation`</b>: a Python function that builds a computation to apply to each
    shard of the input.
* <b>`inputs`</b>: a list of input tensors or None (equivalent to an empty
    list). The 0-th dimension of each Tensor must have size
    divisible by `num_shards`.
* <b>`num_shards`</b>: the number of shards.
* <b>`infeed_queue`</b>: if not None, the InfeedQueue from which to append a tuple
    of arguments as inputs to `computation`.
* <b>`global_tpu_id`</b>: if not None, a Numpy 2D array indicating the global
    id of each TPU device in the system. The outer dimension of the
    array is host task id, and the inner dimension is device ordinal,
    so e.g., global_tpu_id[x][y] indicates the global id of device
    /task:x/device:TPU_NODE:y.
* <b>`name`</b>: name of the operator.

#### Returns:

A list of output tensors.

#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if num_shards <= 0
