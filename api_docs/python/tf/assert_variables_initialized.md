# tf.assert_variables_initialized

``` python
assert_variables_initialized(var_list=None)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/ops/variables.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/ops/variables.py).

See the guide: [Variables > Variable helper functions](../../../api_guides/python/state_ops.md#Variable_helper_functions)

Returns an Op to check if variables are initialized.

NOTE: This function is obsolete and will be removed in 6 months.  Please
change your implementation to use `report_uninitialized_variables()`.

When run, the returned Op will raise the exception `FailedPreconditionError`
if any of the variables has not yet been initialized.

Note: This function is implemented by trying to fetch the values of the
variables. If one of the variables is not initialized a message may be
logged by the C++ runtime. This is expected.

#### Args:

* <b>`var_list`</b>: List of `Variable` objects to check. Defaults to the
    value of `global_variables().`


#### Returns:

  An Op, or None if there are no variables.


**NOTE** The output of this function should be used.  If it is not, a warning will be logged.  To mark the output as used, call its .mark_used() method.
