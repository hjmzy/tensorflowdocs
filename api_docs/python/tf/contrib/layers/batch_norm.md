Adds a Batch Normalization layer from http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167.

  "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing
  Internal Covariate Shift"

  Sergey Ioffe, Christian Szegedy

Can be used as a normalizer function for conv2d and fully_connected.

Note: when training, the moving_mean and moving_variance need to be updated.
By default the update ops are placed in `tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS`, so they
need to be added as a dependency to the `train_op`. For example:

```python
  update_ops = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS)
  with tf.control_dependencies(update_ops):
    train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)
```

One can set updates_collections=None to force the updates in place, but that
can have a speed penalty, especially in distributed settings.

#### Args:

* <b>`inputs`</b>: A tensor with 2 or more dimensions, where the first dimension has
    `batch_size`. The normalization is over all but the last dimension if
    `data_format` is `NHWC` and the second dimension if `data_format` is
    `NCHW`.
* <b>`decay`</b>: Decay for the moving average. Reasonable values for `decay` are close
    to 1.0, typically in the multiple-nines range: 0.999, 0.99, 0.9, etc.
    Lower `decay` value (recommend trying `decay`=0.9) if model experiences
    reasonably good training performance but poor validation and/or test
    performance. Try zero_debias_moving_mean=True for improved stability.
* <b>`center`</b>: If True, add offset of `beta` to normalized tensor. If False, `beta`
    is ignored.
* <b>`scale`</b>: If True, multiply by `gamma`. If False, `gamma` is
    not used. When the next layer is linear (also e.g. `nn.relu`), this can be
    disabled since the scaling can be done by the next layer.
* <b>`epsilon`</b>: Small float added to variance to avoid dividing by zero.
* <b>`activation_fn`</b>: Activation function, default set to None to skip it and
    maintain a linear activation.
* <b>`param_initializers`</b>: Optional initializers for beta, gamma, moving mean and
    moving variance.
* <b>`param_regularizers`</b>: Optional regularizer for beta and gamma.
* <b>`updates_collections`</b>: Collections to collect the update ops for computation.
    The updates_ops need to be executed with the train_op.
    If None, a control dependency would be added to make sure the updates are
    computed in place.
* <b>`is_training`</b>: Whether or not the layer is in training mode. In training mode
    it would accumulate the statistics of the moments into `moving_mean` and
    `moving_variance` using an exponential moving average with the given
    `decay`. When it is not in training mode then it would use the values of
    the `moving_mean` and the `moving_variance`.
* <b>`reuse`</b>: Whether or not the layer and its variables should be reused. To be
    able to reuse the layer scope must be given.
* <b>`variables_collections`</b>: Optional collections for the variables.
* <b>`outputs_collections`</b>: Collections to add the outputs.
* <b>`trainable`</b>: If `True` also add variables to the graph collection
    `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES` (see `tf.Variable`).
* <b>`batch_weights`</b>: An optional tensor of shape `[batch_size]`,
    containing a frequency weight for each batch item. If present,
    then the batch normalization uses weighted mean and
    variance. (This can be used to correct for bias in training
    example selection.)
* <b>`fused`</b>: if `True`, use a faster, fused implementation if possible.
    If `None`, use the system recommended implementation.
* <b>`data_format`</b>: A string. `NHWC` (default) and `NCHW` are supported.
* <b>`zero_debias_moving_mean`</b>: Use zero_debias for moving_mean. It creates a new
    pair of variables 'moving_mean/biased' and 'moving_mean/local_step'.
* <b>`scope`</b>: Optional scope for `variable_scope`.
* <b>`renorm`</b>: Whether to use Batch Renormalization
    (https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03275). This adds extra variables during
    training. The inference is the same for either value of this parameter.
* <b>`renorm_clipping`</b>: A dictionary that may map keys 'rmax', 'rmin', 'dmax' to
    scalar `Tensors` used to clip the renorm correction. The correction
    `(r, d)` is used as `corrected_value = normalized_value * r + d`, with
    `r` clipped to [rmin, rmax], and `d` to [-dmax, dmax]. Missing rmax, rmin,
    dmax are set to inf, 0, inf, respectively.
* <b>`renorm_decay`</b>: Momentum used to update the moving means and standard
    deviations with renorm. Unlike `momentum`, this affects training
    and should be neither too small (which would add noise) nor too large
    (which would give stale estimates). Note that `decay` is still applied
    to get the means and variances for inference.


#### Returns:

A `Tensor` representing the output of the operation.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `data_format` is neither `NHWC` nor `NCHW`.
* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If the rank of `inputs` is undefined.
* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If rank or channels dimension of `inputs` is undefined.
