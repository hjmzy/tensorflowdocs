Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/head.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/head.py).

Creates a Head for multi label classification.

Multi-label classification handles the case where each example may have zero
or more associated labels, from a discrete set.  This is distinct from
`multi_class_head` which has exactly one label from a discrete set.

This head by default uses sigmoid cross entropy loss, which expects as input
a multi-hot tensor of shape `(batch_size, num_classes)`.

#### Args:

* <b>`n_classes`</b>: Integer, number of classes, must be >= 2
* <b>`label_name`</b>: String, name of the key in label dict. Can be null if label
      is a tensor (single headed models).
* <b>`weight_column_name`</b>: A string defining feature column name representing
    weights. It is used to down weight or boost examples during training. It
    will be multiplied by the loss of the example.
* <b>`enable_centered_bias`</b>: A bool. If True, estimator will learn a centered
    bias variable for each class. Rest of the model structure learns the
    residual after centered bias.
* <b>`head_name`</b>: name of the head. If provided, predictions, summary and metrics
    keys will be suffixed by `"/" + head_name` and the default variable scope
    will be `head_name`.
* <b>`thresholds`</b>: thresholds for eval metrics, defaults to [.5]
* <b>`metric_class_ids`</b>: List of class IDs for which we should report per-class
    metrics. Must all be in the range `[0, n_classes)`.
* <b>`loss_fn`</b>: Optional function that takes (`labels`, `logits`, `weights`) as
    parameter and returns a weighted scalar loss. `weights` should be
    optional. See `tf.losses`


#### Returns:

An instance of `Head` for multi label classification.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If n_classes is < 2
* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If loss_fn does not have expected signature.
