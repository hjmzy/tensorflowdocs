# tf.contrib.framework.nest.flatten_dict_items

``` python
flatten_dict_items(dictionary)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/util/nest.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/util/nest.py).

Returns a dictionary with flattened keys and values.

This function flattens the keys and values of a dictionary, which can be
arbitrarily nested structures, and returns the flattened version of such
structures:

```python
example_dictionary = {(4, 5, (6, 8)): ("a", "b", ("c", "d"))}
result = {4: "a", 5: "b", 6: "c", 8: "d"}
flatten_dict_items(example_dictionary) == result
```

The input dictionary must satisfy two properties:

1. Its keys and values should have the same exact nested structure.
2. The set of all flattened keys of the dictionary must not contain repeated
   keys.

#### Args:

* <b>`dictionary`</b>: the dictionary to zip


#### Returns:

The zipped dictionary.


#### Raises:

* <b>`TypeError`</b>: If the input is not a dictionary.
* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If any key and value have not the same structure, or if keys are
    not unique.
