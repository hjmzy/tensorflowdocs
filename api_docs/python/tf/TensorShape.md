# tf.TensorShape

## Class `TensorShape`





Defined in [`tensorflow/python/framework/tensor_shape.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/framework/tensor_shape.py).

See the guide: [Building Graphs > Defining new operations](../../../api_guides/python/framework.md#Defining_new_operations)

Represents the shape of a `Tensor`.

A `TensorShape` represents a possibly-partial shape specification for a
`Tensor`. It may be one of the following:

* *Fully-known shape:* has a known number of dimensions and a known size
  for each dimension. e.g. `TensorShape([16, 256])`
* *Partially-known shape:* has a known number of dimensions, and an unknown
  size for one or more dimension. e.g. `TensorShape([None, 256])`
* *Unknown shape:* has an unknown number of dimensions, and an unknown
  size in all dimensions. e.g. `TensorShape(None)`

If a tensor is produced by an operation of type `"Foo"`, its shape
may be inferred if there is a registered shape function for
`"Foo"`. See [`Shape functions in C++`](../../../extend/adding_an_op.md#shape-functions-in-c)
for details of shape functions and how to register them. Alternatively,
the shape may be set explicitly using [`tf.Tensor.set_shape`](../tf/Tensor.md#set_shape).

## Properties

<h3 id="dims"><code>dims</code></h3>

Returns a list of Dimensions, or None if the shape is unspecified.

<h3 id="ndims"><code>ndims</code></h3>

Returns the rank of this shape, or None if it is unspecified.



## Methods

<h3 id="__init__"><code>__init__</code></h3>

``` python
__init__(dims)
```

Creates a new TensorShape with the given dimensions.

#### Args:

* <b>`dims`</b>: A list of Dimensions, or None if the shape is unspecified.
* <b>`DEPRECATED`</b>: A single integer is treated as a singleton list.


#### Raises:

* <b>`TypeError`</b>: If dims cannot be converted to a list of dimensions.

<h3 id="__bool__"><code>__bool__</code></h3>

<h3 id="__getitem__"><code>__getitem__</code></h3>

``` python
__getitem__(key)
```

Returns the value of a dimension or a shape, depending on the key.

#### Args:

* <b>`key`</b>: If `key` is an integer, returns the dimension at that index;
    otherwise if `key` is a slice, returns a TensorShape whose
    dimensions are those selected by the slice from `self`.


#### Returns:

A dimension if `key` is an integer, or a `TensorShape` if `key` is a
slice.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `key` is a slice, and any of its elements are negative, or
    if `self` is completely unknown and the step is set.

<h3 id="__iter__"><code>__iter__</code></h3>

``` python
__iter__()
```

Returns `self.dims` if the rank is known, otherwise raises ValueError.

<h3 id="__len__"><code>__len__</code></h3>

``` python
__len__()
```

Returns the rank of this shape, or raises ValueError if unspecified.

<h3 id="__ne__"><code>__ne__</code></h3>

``` python

```

Returns True if `self` is known to be different from `other`.

<h3 id="__nonzero__"><code>__nonzero__</code></h3>

``` python
__nonzero__()
```

Returns True if this shape contains non-zero information.

<h3 id="as_list"><code>as_list</code></h3>

``` python
as_list()
```

Returns a list of integers or `None` for each dimension.

#### Returns:

A list of integers or `None` for each dimension.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `self` is an unknown shape with an unknown rank.

<h3 id="as_proto"><code>as_proto</code></h3>

``` python
as_proto()
```

Returns this shape as a `TensorShapeProto`.

<h3 id="assert_has_rank"><code>assert_has_rank</code></h3>

``` python
assert_has_rank(rank)
```

Raises an exception if `self` is not compatible with the given `rank`.

#### Args:

* <b>`rank`</b>: An integer.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `self` does not represent a shape with the given `rank`.

<h3 id="assert_is_compatible_with"><code>assert_is_compatible_with</code></h3>

``` python
assert_is_compatible_with(other)
```

Raises exception if `self` and `other` do not represent the same shape.

This method can be used to assert that there exists a shape that both
`self` and `other` represent.

#### Args:

* <b>`other`</b>: Another TensorShape.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `self` and `other` do not represent the same shape.

<h3 id="assert_is_fully_defined"><code>assert_is_fully_defined</code></h3>

``` python
assert_is_fully_defined()
```

Raises an exception if `self` is not fully defined in every dimension.

#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `self` does not have a known value for every dimension.

<h3 id="assert_same_rank"><code>assert_same_rank</code></h3>

``` python
assert_same_rank(other)
```

Raises an exception if `self` and `other` do not have compatible ranks.

#### Args:

* <b>`other`</b>: Another `TensorShape`.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `self` and `other` do not represent shapes with the
    same rank.

<h3 id="concatenate"><code>concatenate</code></h3>

``` python
concatenate(other)
```

Returns the concatenation of the dimension in `self` and `other`.

*N.B.* If either `self` or `other` is completely unknown,
concatenation will discard information about the other shape. In
future, we might support concatenation that preserves this
information for use with slicing.

#### Args:

* <b>`other`</b>: Another `TensorShape`.


#### Returns:

A `TensorShape` whose dimensions are the concatenation of the
dimensions in `self` and `other`.

<h3 id="is_compatible_with"><code>is_compatible_with</code></h3>

``` python
is_compatible_with(other)
```

Returns True iff `self` is compatible with `other`.

Two possibly-partially-defined shapes are compatible if there
exists a fully-defined shape that both shapes can represent. Thus,
compatibility allows the shape inference code to reason about
partially-defined shapes. For example:

* TensorShape(None) is compatible with all shapes.

* TensorShape([None, None]) is compatible with all two-dimensional
  shapes, such as TensorShape([32, 784]), and also TensorShape(None). It is
  not compatible with, for example, TensorShape([None]) or
  TensorShape([None, None, None]).

* TensorShape([32, None]) is compatible with all two-dimensional shapes
  with size 32 in the 0th dimension, and also TensorShape([None, None])
  and TensorShape(None). It is not compatible with, for example,
  TensorShape([32]), TensorShape([32, None, 1]) or TensorShape([64, None]).

* TensorShape([32, 784]) is compatible with itself, and also
  TensorShape([32, None]), TensorShape([None, 784]), TensorShape([None,
  None]) and TensorShape(None). It is not compatible with, for example,
  TensorShape([32, 1, 784]) or TensorShape([None]).

The compatibility relation is reflexive and symmetric, but not
transitive. For example, TensorShape([32, 784]) is compatible with
TensorShape(None), and TensorShape(None) is compatible with
TensorShape([4, 4]), but TensorShape([32, 784]) is not compatible with
TensorShape([4, 4]).

#### Args:

* <b>`other`</b>: Another TensorShape.


#### Returns:

True iff `self` is compatible with `other`.

<h3 id="is_fully_defined"><code>is_fully_defined</code></h3>

``` python
is_fully_defined()
```

Returns True iff `self` is fully defined in every dimension.

<h3 id="merge_with"><code>merge_with</code></h3>

``` python
merge_with(other)
```

Returns a `TensorShape` combining the information in `self` and `other`.

The dimensions in `self` and `other` are merged elementwise,
according to the rules defined for `Dimension.merge_with()`.

#### Args:

* <b>`other`</b>: Another `TensorShape`.


#### Returns:

A `TensorShape` containing the combined information of `self` and
`other`.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `self` and `other` are not compatible.

<h3 id="most_specific_compatible_shape"><code>most_specific_compatible_shape</code></h3>

``` python
most_specific_compatible_shape(other)
```

Returns the most specific TensorShape compatible with `self` and `other`.

* TensorShape([None, 1]) is the most specific TensorShape compatible with
  both TensorShape([2, 1]) and TensorShape([5, 1]). Note that
  TensorShape(None) is also compatible with above mentioned TensorShapes.

* TensorShape([1, 2, 3]) is the most specific TensorShape compatible with
  both TensorShape([1, 2, 3]) and TensorShape([1, 2, 3]). There are more
  less specific TensorShapes compatible with above mentioned TensorShapes,
  e.g. TensorShape([1, 2, None]), TensorShape(None).

#### Args:

* <b>`other`</b>: Another `TensorShape`.


#### Returns:

A `TensorShape` which is the most specific compatible shape of `self`
and `other`.

<h3 id="num_elements"><code>num_elements</code></h3>

``` python
num_elements()
```

Returns the total number of elements, or none for incomplete shapes.

<h3 id="with_rank"><code>with_rank</code></h3>

``` python
with_rank(rank)
```

    `rank`.

<h3 id="with_rank_at_most"><code>with_rank_at_most</code></h3>

``` python
with_rank_at_most(rank)
```
