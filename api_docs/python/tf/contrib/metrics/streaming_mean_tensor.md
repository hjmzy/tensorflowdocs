# tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_mean_tensor

``` python
streaming_mean_tensor(
    values,
    weights=None,
    metrics_collections=None,
    updates_collections=None,
    name=None
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/metrics/python/ops/metric_ops.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/metrics/python/ops/metric_ops.py).

See the guide: [Metrics (contrib) > Metric `Ops`](../../../../../api_guides/python/contrib.metrics.md#Metric_Ops_)

Computes the element-wise (weighted) mean of the given tensors.

In contrast to the `streaming_mean` function which returns a scalar with the
mean,  this function returns an average tensor with the same shape as the
input tensors.

The `streaming_mean_tensor` function creates two local variables,
`total_tensor` and `count_tensor` that are used to compute the average of
`values`. This average is ultimately returned as `mean` which is an idempotent
operation that simply divides `total` by `count`.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `mean`.
`update_op` increments `total` with the reduced sum of the product of `values`
and `weights`, and it increments `count` with the reduced sum of `weights`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

#### Args:

* <b>`values`</b>: A `Tensor` of arbitrary dimensions.
* <b>`weights`</b>: `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as `values`, and
    must be broadcastable to `values` (i.e., all dimensions must be either
    `1`, or the same as the corresponding `values` dimension).
* <b>`metrics_collections`</b>: An optional list of collections that `mean`
    should be added to.
* <b>`updates_collections`</b>: An optional list of collections that `update_op`
    should be added to.
* <b>`name`</b>: An optional variable_scope name.


#### Returns:

* <b>`mean`</b>: A float `Tensor` representing the current mean, the value of `total`
    divided by `count`.
* <b>`update_op`</b>: An operation that increments the `total` and `count` variables
    appropriately and whose value matches `mean`.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `values`,
    or if either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list
    or tuple.
