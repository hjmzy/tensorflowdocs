Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/training/python/training/training.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/training/python/training/training.py).

Runs the training loop.

#### Args:

* <b>`train_op`</b>: A `Tensor` that, when executed, will apply the gradients and
    return the loss value.
* <b>`logdir`</b>: The directory where the graph and checkpoints are saved.
* <b>`master`</b>: The URL of the master.
* <b>`is_chief`</b>: Specifies whether or not the training is being run by the primary
    replica during replica training.
* <b>`scaffold`</b>: An tf.train.Scaffold instance.
* <b>`hooks`</b>: List of `tf.train.SessionRunHook` callbacks which are run inside the
    training loop.
* <b>`chief_only_hooks`</b>: List of `tf.train.SessionRunHook` instances which are run
    inside the training loop for the chief trainer only.
* <b>`save_checkpoint_secs`</b>: The frequency, in seconds, that a checkpoint is saved
    using a default checkpoint saver. If `save_checkpoint_secs` is set to
    `None`, then the default checkpoint saver isn't used.
* <b>`save_summaries_steps`</b>: The frequency, in number of global steps, that the
    summaries are written to disk using a default summary saver. If
    `save_summaries_steps` is set to `None`, then the default summary saver
    isn't used.
* <b>`config`</b>: An instance of `tf.ConfigProto`.


#### Returns:

the value of the loss function after training.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if `logdir` is `None` and either `save_checkpoint_secs` or
  `save_summaries_steps` are `None.
