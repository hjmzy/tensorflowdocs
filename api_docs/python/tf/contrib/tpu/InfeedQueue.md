# tf.contrib.tpu.InfeedQueue

## Class `InfeedQueue`





Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/tpu/python/tpu/tpu_feed.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/tpu/python/tpu/tpu_feed.py).

A helper object to build a device infeed queue.

The InfeedQueue builds the host-side and device-side Ops to enqueue and
dequeue elements, respectively, and ensures that their types and
shapes match.

## Properties

<h3 id="number_of_shards"><code>number_of_shards</code></h3>

Gets the number of shards to use for the InfeedQueue.

#### Returns:

Number of shards or None if the number of shards has not been set.

<h3 id="number_of_tuple_elements"><code>number_of_tuple_elements</code></h3>

Returns the number of InfeedQueue tuple elements.

<h3 id="shard_dimensions"><code>shard_dimensions</code></h3>

Gets the shard dimension of each tuple element.

#### Returns:

A list of length number_of_tuple_elements, where each list entry
is the shard dimension of that tuple element or None if the
shard dimension has not been set.

<h3 id="sharding_policies"><code>sharding_policies</code></h3>

Returns the sharding policies of the InfeedQueue tuple elements.

<h3 id="tuple_shapes"><code>tuple_shapes</code></h3>

Returns the shapes of the InfeedQueue tuple elements.

<h3 id="tuple_types"><code>tuple_types</code></h3>

Returns the types of the InfeedQueue tuple elements.



## Methods

<h3 id="__init__"><code>__init__</code></h3>

``` python
__init__(
    number_of_tuple_elements=None,
    tuple_types=None,
    tuple_shapes=None,
    shard_dimensions=None,
    name=None
)
```

Creates a new InfeedQueue with the given configuration.

The configuration need not be fully specified at creation since it
can be modified subsequently by methods that set the values
explicitly or infer them from the shapes of inputs.

#### Args:

* <b>`number_of_tuple_elements`</b>: the number of Tensors fed atomically through the
    queue, must be present unless it can be inferred from other arguments.
* <b>`tuple_types`</b>: if not None, a list of types of the elements of the queue.
* <b>`tuple_shapes`</b>: if not None, a list of shapes of the elements of the queue.
* <b>`shard_dimensions`</b>: if not None, a list of dimensions on which the
    elements of the queue should be sharded during automatic
    parallelization.
* <b>`name`</b>: the name of the queue.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if number_of_tuple_elements <= 0; or
    number_of_tuple_arguments, tuple_types, tuple_shapes, and
    shard_dimensions are all None; or the length of tuple_types,
    tuple_shapes, or shard_dimensions is not equal to
    number_of_tuple_elements; or any element of shard_dimensions
    can't be converted to a Dimension.
* <b>`TypeError`</b>: if any element of tuple_types or tuple_shapes can't
    be converted to a dtype or TensorShape, respectively.

<h3 id="freeze"><code>freeze</code></h3>

``` python
freeze()
```

Freezes the InfeedQueue so it can no longer be modified.

The configuration is implicitly frozen before any host-side or
device-side Ops are generated. The configuration cannot be frozen
until the types and shapes of the tuple elements have been set.

#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if the types or shapes of the tuple elements have not been
  set.

<h3 id="generate_dequeue_op"><code>generate_dequeue_op</code></h3>

``` python
generate_dequeue_op()
```

Generates the device-side Op to dequeue a tuple from the queue.

Implicitly freezes the queue configuration if it is not already
frozen, which will raise errors if the shapes and types have not
been fully specified.

#### Returns:

A list of Outputs corresponding to a shard of infeed dequeued
into XLA, suitable for use within a replicated block.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if the types or shapes of the tuple elements have not been
  set; or if a dequeue op has already been generated.

<h3 id="generate_enqueue_ops"><code>generate_enqueue_ops</code></h3>

``` python
generate_enqueue_ops(
    sharded_inputs,
    tpu_ordinal_function=None
)
```

Generates the host-side Ops to enqueue the shards of a tuple.

sharded_inputs is a list, one for each shard, of lists of
Tensors. sharded_inputs[0] is the tuple of Tensors to use to feed
shard 0 if the queue. Returns the host-side Ops that must be run to
enqueue the sharded tuple. The Op for shard i is colocated with the inputs
for shard i.

Implicitly freezes the queue configuration if it is not already
frozen. If the configuration has already been frozen, and is not
compatible with the types and shapes of sharded_inputs, an error
will be raised.

#### Args:

* <b>`sharded_inputs`</b>: a list of lists of Tensors. The length of the outer list
    determines the number of shards. Each inner list indicates the types
    and shapes of the tuples in the corresponding shard.
* <b>`tpu_ordinal_function`</b>: if not None, a function that takes the
    shard index as input and returns the ordinal of the TPU device
    the shard's infeed should be placed on. tpu_ordinal_function must be
    set if the inputs are placed on CPU devices.


#### Returns:

A list of host-side Ops, one for each shard, that when executed together
will enqueue a full-size element of infeed.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if the queue configuration has previously been frozen and the
    shapes of the elements of sharded_inputs are not compatible with the
    frozen configuration; or if the shapes of the elements of sharded_inputs
    don't form a consistent unsharded tuple; or if the elements of a tuple
    have different device constraints.
* <b>`TypeError`</b>: if the queue configuration has previously been frozen and the
    types of the elements of sharded_inputs are not compatible with the
    frozen configuration; or if the types of the elements of sharded_inputs
    don't form a consistent unsharded tuple.

<h3 id="set_configuration_from_input_tensors"><code>set_configuration_from_input_tensors</code></h3>

``` python
set_configuration_from_input_tensors(input_tensors)
```

Sets the shapes and types of the queue tuple elements.

input_tensors is a list of Tensors whose types and shapes are used
to set the queue configuration.

#### Args:

* <b>`input_tensors`</b>: list of Tensors of the same types and shapes as
    the desired queue Tuple.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if input_tensors is not a list of length
    self.number_of_tuple_elements

<h3 id="set_configuration_from_sharded_input_tensors"><code>set_configuration_from_sharded_input_tensors</code></h3>

``` python
set_configuration_from_sharded_input_tensors(input_tensors)
```

Sets the shapes and types of the queue tuple elements.

input_tensors is a list of lists of Tensors whose types and shapes are used
to set the queue configuration. The length of the outer list is the number
of shards required, and each inner list is the tuple of Tensors to use to
determine the types and shapes of the corresponding shard. This method
depends on the shard dimension, and calling it freezes the shard policy.

#### Args:

* <b>`input_tensors`</b>: list of lists of Tensors. The outer list length corresponds
    to the desired number of shards, and each inner list is the size
    and shape of the desired configuration of the corresponding shard.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if any inner list is not a list of length
    self.number_of_tuple_elements; or the inner lists do not combine to
    form a consistent unsharded shape.
* <b>`TypeError`</b>: if the types of the Tensors in the inner lists do not match.

<h3 id="set_number_of_shards"><code>set_number_of_shards</code></h3>

``` python
set_number_of_shards(number_of_shards)
```

Sets the number of shards to use for the InfeedQueue.

#### Args:

* <b>`number_of_shards`</b>: number of ways to shard the InfeedQueue.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if number_of_shards is not > 0; or the policies have
    been frozen and number_of_shards was already set to something
    else.

<h3 id="set_shard_dimensions"><code>set_shard_dimensions</code></h3>

``` python
set_shard_dimensions(shard_dimensions)
```

Sets the shard_dimension of each element of the queue.

shard_dimensions must be a list of length
self.number_of_tuple_elements, and each element must be
convertible to a Dimension compatible with self.tuple_shapes.

#### Args:

* <b>`shard_dimensions`</b>: the dimensions of each queue element.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if shard_dimensions is not of length
    self.number_of_tuple_elements; or an element of
    shard_dimensions cannot be converted to a Dimension; or an
    element of shard_dimensions is a Dimension that is out of
    range for the corresponding tuple element shape.

<h3 id="set_tuple_shapes"><code>set_tuple_shapes</code></h3>

``` python
set_tuple_shapes(tuple_shapes)
```

Sets the shape of each element of the queue.

tuple_shapes must be a list of length
self.number_of_tuple_elements, and each element must be
convertible to a TensorShape.

#### Args:

* <b>`tuple_shapes`</b>: the shapes of each queue element.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if tuple_shapes is not of length
    self.number_of_tuple_elements.
* <b>`TypeError`</b>: if an element of tuple_shapes cannot be converted to
    a TensorShape.

<h3 id="set_tuple_types"><code>set_tuple_types</code></h3>

``` python
set_tuple_types(tuple_types)
```

Sets the type of each element of the queue.

tuple_types must be a list of length
self.number_of_tuple_elements, and each element must be
convertible to a dtype.

#### Args:

* <b>`tuple_types`</b>: the types of each queue element.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if tuple_types is not of length
    self.number_of_tuple_elements.
* <b>`TypeError`</b>: if an element of tuple_types cannot be converted to a
    dtype.

<h3 id="split_inputs_and_generate_enqueue_ops"><code>split_inputs_and_generate_enqueue_ops</code></h3>

``` python
split_inputs_and_generate_enqueue_ops(
    inputs,
    global_tpu_id=None,
    placement_function=None,
    tpu_ordinal_function=None
)
```

POORLY-PERFORMING ON MULTI-HOST SYSTEMS.

Generates the host-side Ops to enqueue a tuple.

This method performs poorly because it takes an entire input on a single
host, splits it, and distributes it to all of the cores. It is present only
to simplify tutorial examples.

inputs is a list of Tensors to use to feed the queue. Each input is split
into self.number_of_shards shards. Returns an Op for each shard to enqueue
the shard. The Op for shard i is placed on device placement_function(i).

Implicitly freezes the queue configuration if it is not already
frozen. If the configuration has already been frozen, and is not
compatible with the types and shapes of inputs, an error
will be raised.

#### Args:

* <b>`inputs`</b>: a list of Tensors which indicates the types and shapes of the
    queue tuple.
 global_tpu_id: if not None, a Numpy 2D array indicating the global
    id of each TPU device in the system. The outer dimension of the
    array is host task id, and the inner dimension is device ordinal,
    so e.g., global_tpu_id[x][y] indicates the global id of device
    /task:x/device:TPU_NODE:y. If global_tpu_id is not None, but
    placement_function and ordinal_function are None, then global_tpu_id
    will be used to place infeed on the TPUs with the first k global ids,
    where k is the number of shards in the queue.
* <b>`placement_function`</b>: if not None, a function that takes the shard
    index as input and returns a device string indicating which
    device the shard's infeed should be placed on. If placement_function
    and tpu_ordinal_function are None, inputs are sharded round-robin
    across the devices in the system.
* <b>`tpu_ordinal_function`</b>: if not None, a function that takes the
    shard index as input and returns the ordinal of the TPU device
    the shard's infeed should be placed on. If placement_function
    and tpu_ordinal_function are None, inputs are sharded round-robin
    across the devices in the system.


#### Returns:

A list of host-side Ops, one for each shard, that when executed together
will enqueue a full-size element of infeed.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if the queue configuration has previously been frozen and the
    shapes of the elements of inputs are not compatible with the frozen
    configuration.
* <b>`TypeError`</b>: if the queue configuration has previously been frozen and the
    types of the elements of inputs are not compatible with the frozen
    configuration.
