# tf.nn.dropout

``` python
dropout(
    x,
    keep_prob,
    noise_shape=None,
    seed=None,
    name=None
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/ops/nn_ops.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/ops/nn_ops.py).

See the guides: [Layers (contrib) > Higher level ops for building neural network layers](../../../../api_guides/python/contrib.layers.md#Higher_level_ops_for_building_neural_network_layers), [Neural Network > Activation Functions](../../../../api_guides/python/nn.md#Activation_Functions)

Computes dropout.

With probability `keep_prob`, outputs the input element scaled up by
`1 / keep_prob`, otherwise outputs `0`.  The scaling is so that the expected
sum is unchanged.

By default, each element is kept or dropped independently.  If `noise_shape`
is specified, it must be
[broadcastable](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html)
to the shape of `x`, and only dimensions with `noise_shape[i] == shape(x)[i]`
will make independent decisions.  For example, if `shape(x) = [k, l, m, n]`
and `noise_shape = [k, 1, 1, n]`, each batch and channel component will be
kept independently and each row and column will be kept or not kept together.

#### Args:

* <b>`x`</b>: A floating point tensor.
* <b>`keep_prob`</b>: A scalar `Tensor` with the same type as x. The probability
    that each element is kept.
* <b>`noise_shape`</b>: A 1-D `Tensor` of type `int32`, representing the
    shape for randomly generated keep/drop flags.
* <b>`seed`</b>: A Python integer. Used to create random seeds. See
    [`tf.set_random_seed`](../../tf/set_random_seed.md)
    for behavior.
* <b>`name`</b>: A name for this operation (optional).


#### Returns:

A Tensor of the same shape of `x`.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `keep_prob` is not in `(0, 1]` or if `x` is not a floating
    point tensor.
