# tf.contrib.framework.load_linear_multiclass_bias_initializer

    bias_tensor_name,
    new_class_vocab_size,
    old_class_vocab_file,

```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/ops/checkpoint_ops.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/ops/checkpoint_ops.py).

Loads pre-trained multi-class biases for linear models from checkpoint.

Wrapper around `load_and_remap_matrix_initializer()` specialized for loading
multi-class bias and remapping according to the provided vocab files. See docs
for `load_and_remap_matrix_initializer()` for more details. In this case, the
provided row_vocab is the class vocabulary, and the expected shape is
`[new_class_vocab_size, 1]`.

#### Args:

* <b>`ckpt_path`</b>: Path to the TensorFlow checkpoint (version 2, `TensorBundle`)
    from which the old matrix `Tensor` will be loaded.
* <b>`bias_tensor_name`</b>: Tensor name to load from in the checkpoints.
* <b>`new_class_vocab_size`</b>: Number of entries in the new class vocab.
* <b>`old_class_vocab_file`</b>: A scalar `Tensor` of type `string` containing the
    path to the old class vocabulary file.
* <b>`new_class_vocab_file`</b>: A scalar `Tensor` of type `string` containing the
    path to the new class vocabulary file.
* <b>`num_class_oov_buckets`</b>: `int` specifying the number of out-of-vocabulary
    buckets to use for the classes. Must be >= 0.
* <b>`initializer`</b>: Initializer function that accepts a 1-D tensor as the arg to
    specify the shape of the returned tensor. If `None`, defaults to using
    `zeros_initializer()`.
* <b>`max_rows_in_memory`</b>: `int` specifying the maximum number of rows to load from
    the checkpoint at once. If less than or equal to 0, the entire matrix will
    be loaded into memory. Setting this arg trades increased disk reads for
    lower memory usage.


#### Returns:

A variable initializer function.
