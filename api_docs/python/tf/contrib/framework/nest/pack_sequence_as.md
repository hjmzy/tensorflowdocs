# tf.contrib.framework.nest.pack_sequence_as

``` python
pack_sequence_as(
    structure,
    flat_sequence
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/util/nest.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/util/nest.py).

Returns a given flattened sequence packed into a given structure.

If `structure` is a scalar, `flat_sequence` must be a single-element list;
in this case the return value is `flat_sequence[0]`.

If `structure` is or contains a dict instance, the keys will be sorted to
pack the flat sequence in deterministic order. This is true also for
`OrderedDict` instances: their sequence order is ignored, the sorting order of
keys is used instead. The same convention is followed in `pack_sequence_as`.
This correctly repacks dicts and `OrderedDict`s after they have been
flattened, and also allows flattening an `OrderedDict` and then repacking it
back using a correponding plain dict, or vice-versa.
Dictionaries with non-sortable keys cannot be flattened.

#### Args:

* <b>`structure`</b>: Nested structure, whose structure is given by nested lists,
      tuples, and dicts. Note: numpy arrays and strings are considered
      scalars.
* <b>`flat_sequence`</b>: flat sequence to pack.


#### Returns:

* <b>`packed`</b>: `flat_sequence` converted to have the same recursive structure as
    `structure`.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `flat_sequence` and `structure` have different
    element counts.
* <b>`TypeError`</b>: `structure` is or contains a dict with non-sortable keys.
