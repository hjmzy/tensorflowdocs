# tf.contrib.tpu.shard

``` python
shard(
    computation,
    inputs=None,
    num_shards=1,
    input_shard_axes=None,
    outputs_from_all_shards=True,
    output_shard_axes=None,
    infeed_queue=None,
    global_tpu_id=None,
    name=None
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/tpu/python/tpu/tpu.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/tpu/python/tpu/tpu.py).

Shards `computation` for parallel execution.

`inputs` must be a list of Tensors or None (equivalent to an empty
list), each of which has a corresponding split axis (from
`input_shard_axes`). Each input is split into `num_shards` pieces
along the corresponding axis, and computation is applied to each
shard in parallel.

Tensors are broadcast to all shards if they are lexically captured by
`computation`. e.g.,

x = tf.constant(7)
def computation():
  return x + 3
... = shard(computation, ...)

TODO(phawkins): consider adding support for broadcasting Tensors passed
as inputs.

If `outputs_from_all_shards` is true, the outputs from all shards of
`computation` are concatenated back together along their `output_shards_axes`.
Otherwise, each output is taken from an arbitrary shard.

Inputs and outputs of the computation must be at least rank-1 Tensors.

#### Args:

* <b>`computation`</b>: a Python function that builds a computation to apply to each
    shard of the input.
* <b>`inputs`</b>: a list of input tensors or None (equivalent to an empty
    list). Each input tensor has a corresponding shard axes, given
    by `input_shard_axes`, which must have size divisible by
    `num_shards`.
* <b>`num_shards`</b>: the number of shards.
* <b>`input_shard_axes`</b>: a list of dimensions along which to shard `inputs`, or
    `None`. `None` means "shard all inputs along dimension 0". If not `None`,
    there must be one dimension per input.
* <b>`outputs_from_all_shards`</b>: boolean or list of boolean. For each output, if
    `True`, outputs from all shards are concatenated along the corresponding
    `output_shard_axes` entry. Otherwise, each output is taken
    from an arbitrary shard. If the argument is a boolean, the argument's
    value is used for each output.
* <b>`output_shard_axes`</b>: a list of dimensions along which to concatenate the
    outputs of `computation`, or `None`. `None` means "concatenate all outputs
    along dimension 0". If not `None`, there must be one dimension per output.
    Ignored if `outputs_from_all_shards` is False.
* <b>`infeed_queue`</b>: if not None, the InfeedQueue to use to augment the inputs of
    `computation`.
* <b>`global_tpu_id`</b>: if not None, a Numpy 2D array indicating the global
    id of each TPU device in the system. The outer dimension of the
    array is host task id, and the inner dimension is device ordinal,
    so e.g., global_tpu_id[x][y] indicates the global id of device
    /task:x/device:TPU_NODE:y.
* <b>`name`</b>: name of the operator.

#### Returns:

A list of output tensors.

#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if num_shards <= 0
* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if len(input_shard_axes) != len(inputs)
* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if len(output_shard_axes) != len(outputs from `computation`)
