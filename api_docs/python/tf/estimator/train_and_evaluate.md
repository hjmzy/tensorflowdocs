# tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate

``` python
train_and_evaluate(
    estimator,
    train_spec,
    eval_spec
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/estimator/training.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/estimator/training.py).

Train and evaluate the `estimator`.

This utility function trains, evaluates, and (optionally) exports the model by
using the given `estimator`. All training related specification is held in
`train_spec`, including training `input_fn` and training max steps, etc. All
evaluation and export related specification is held in `eval_spec`, including
evaluation `input_fn`, steps, etc.

This utility function provides consistent behavior for both local
(non-distributed) and distributed configurations. Currently, the only
supported distributed training configuration is between-graph replication.

Overfitting: In order to avoid overfitting, it is recommended to set up the
training `input_fn` to shuffle the training data properly. It is also
recommended to train the model a little longer, say multiple epochs, before
performing evaluation, as the input pipeline starts from scratch for each
training. It is particularly important for local training and evaluation.

Stop condition: In order to support both distributed and non-distributed
configuration reliably, the only supported stop condition for model
training is `train_spec.max_steps`. If `train_spec.max_steps` is `None`, the
model is trained forever. *Use with care* if model stop condition is
different. For example, assume that the model is expected to be trained with
one epoch of training data, and the training `input_fn` is configured to throw
`OutOfRangeError` after going through one epoch, which stops the
`Estimator.train`. For a three-training-worker distributed configuration, each
training worker is likely to go through the whole epoch independently. So, the
model will be trained with three epochs of training data instead of one epoch.

Example of local (non-distributed) training:
```python
# Set up feature columns.
categorial_feature_a = categorial_column_with_hash_bucket(...)
categorial_feature_a_emb = embedding_column(
    categorical_column=categorial_feature_a, ...)
...  # other feature columns

estimator = DNNClassifier(
    feature_columns=[categorial_feature_a_emb, ...],
    hidden_units=[1024, 512, 256])

# Or set up the model directory
#   estimator = DNNClassifier(
#       config=tf.estimator.RunConfig(
#           model_dir='/my_model', save_summary_steps=100),
#       feature_columns=[categorial_feature_a_emb, ...],
#       hidden_units=[1024, 512, 256])

# Input pipeline for train and evaluate.
def train_input_fn: # returns x, y
  # please shuffle the data.
  pass
def eval_input_fn_eval: # returns x, y
  pass

train_spec = tf.estimator.TrainSpec(input_fn=train_input_fn, max_steps=1000)
eval_spec = tf.estimator.EvalSpec(input_fn=eval_input_fn)

tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate(estimator, train_spec, eval_spec)
```

Example of distributed training:

Regarding the example of distributed training, the code above can be used
without a change (Please do make sure that the `RunConfig.model_dir` for all
workers is set to the same directory, i.e., a shared file system all workers
can read and write). The only extra work to do is setting the environment
variable `TF_CONFIG` properly for each worker correspondingly.

Also see: https://www.tensorflow.org/deploy/distributed

Setting environment variable depends on the platform. For example, on Linux,
it can be done as follows (`$` is the shell prompt):
```
$ TF_CONFIG='<replace_with_real_content>' python train_model.py
```

For the content in `TF_CONFIG`, assume that the training cluster spec looks
like:
```
cluster = {"chief": ["host0:2222"],
           "worker": ["host1:2222", "host2:2222", "host3:2222"],
           "ps": ["host4:2222", "host5:2222"]}
```

Example of `TF_CONFIG` for chief training worker (must have one and only one):
```
# This should be a JSON string, which is set as environment variable. Usually
# the cluster manager handles that.
TF_CONFIG='{
    "cluster": {
        "chief": ["host0:2222"],
        "worker": ["host1:2222", "host2:2222", "host3:2222"],
        "ps": ["host4:2222", "host5:2222"]
    },
    "task": {"type": "chief", "index": 0}
}'
```
Note that the chief worker also does the model training job, similar to other
non-chief training workers (see next paragraph). In addition to the model
training, it manages some extra work, e.g., checkpoint saving and restoring,
writing summaries, etc.

Example of `TF_CONFIG` for non-chief training worker (optional, could be
multiple):
```
# This should be a JSON string, which is set as environment variable. Usually
# the cluster manager handles that.
TF_CONFIG='{
    "cluster": {
        "chief": ["host0:2222"],
        "worker": ["host1:2222", "host2:2222", "host3:2222"],
        "ps": ["host4:2222", "host5:2222"]
    },
    "task": {"type": "worker", "index": 0}
}'
```
where the `task.index` should be set as 0, 1, 2, in this example, respectively
for non-chief training workers.

Example of `TF_CONFIG` for parameter server, aka ps (could be multiple):
```
# This should be a JSON string, which is set as environment variable. Usually
# the cluster manager handles that.
TF_CONFIG='{
    "cluster": {
        "chief": ["host0:2222"],
        "worker": ["host1:2222", "host2:2222", "host3:2222"],
        "ps": ["host4:2222", "host5:2222"]
    },
    "task": {"type": "ps", "index": 0}
}'
```
where the `task.index` should be set as 0 and 1, in this example, respectively
for parameter servers.

Example of `TF_CONFIG` for evaluator task. Evaluator is a special task that is
not part of the training cluster. There could be only one. It is used for
model evaluation.
```
# This should be a JSON string, which is set as environment variable. Usually
# the cluster manager handles that.
TF_CONFIG='{
    "cluster": {
        "chief": ["host0:2222"],
        "worker": ["host1:2222", "host2:2222", "host3:2222"],
        "ps": ["host4:2222", "host5:2222"]
    },
    "task": {"type": "evaluator", "index": 0}
}'
```
