# Getting Started

For a brief overview of TensorFlow programming fundamentals, see the following
guide:

  * [Getting Started with TensorFlow](../get_started/get_started.md)

MNIST has become the canonical dataset for trying out a new machine learning
toolkit.  We offer three guides that each demonstrate a different approach
to training an MNIST model on TensorFlow:

  * [MNIST for ML Beginners](../get_started/mnist/beginners.md), which introduces MNIST through
    the high-level API.
  * [Deep MNIST for Experts](../get_started/mnist/pros.md), which is more-in depth than
    "MNIST for ML Beginners," and assumes some familiarity with machine
    learning concepts.
  * [TensorFlow Mechanics 101](../get_started/mnist/mechanics.md), which introduces MNIST through
    the low-level API.

For developers new to TensorFlow, the high-level API is a good place to start.
To learn about the high-level API, read the following guides:

  * [tf.estimator Quickstart](../get_started/estimator.md), which introduces this
    API.
  * [Building Input Functions](../get_started/input_fn.md),
    which takes you into a somewhat more sophisticated use of this API.

TensorBoard is a utility to visualize different aspects of machine learning.
The following guides explain how to use TensorBoard:

  * [TensorBoard: Visualizing Learning](../get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard.md),
    which gets you started.
  * [TensorBoard: Graph Visualization](../get_started/graph_viz.md), which explains
    how to visualize the computational graph.  Graph visualization is typically
    more useful for programmers using the low-level API.
