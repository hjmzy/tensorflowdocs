# tf.contrib.linear_optimizer.SdcaModel

## Class `SdcaModel`





Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/linear_optimizer/python/ops/sdca_ops.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/linear_optimizer/python/ops/sdca_ops.py).

Stochastic dual coordinate ascent solver for linear models.

This class currently only supports a single machine (multi-threaded)
implementation. We expect the weights and duals to fit in a single machine.

Loss functions supported:

 * Binary logistic loss
 * Squared loss
 * Hinge loss
 * Smooth hinge loss

This class defines an optimizer API to train a linear model.

### Usage

```python
# Create a solver with the desired parameters.
lr = tf.contrib.linear_optimizer.SdcaModel(examples, variables, options)
min_op = lr.minimize()
opt_op = lr.update_weights(min_op)

predictions = lr.predictions(examples)
# Primal loss + L1 loss + L2 loss.
regularized_loss = lr.regularized_loss(examples)
# Primal loss only
unregularized_loss = lr.unregularized_loss(examples)

examples: {
  sparse_features: list of SparseFeatureColumn.
  dense_features: list of dense tensors of type float32.
  example_labels: a tensor of type float32 and shape [Num examples]
  example_weights: a tensor of type float32 and shape [Num examples]
  example_ids: a tensor of type string and shape [Num examples]
}
variables: {
  sparse_features_weights: list of tensors of shape [vocab size]
  dense_features_weights: list of tensors of shape [dense_feature_dimension]
}
options: {
  symmetric_l1_regularization: 0.0
  symmetric_l2_regularization: 1.0
  loss_type: "logistic_loss"
  num_loss_partitions: 1 (Optional, with default value of 1. Number of
  partitions of the global loss function, 1 means single machine solver,
  and >1 when we have more than one optimizer working concurrently.)
  num_table_shards: 1 (Optional, with default value of 1. Number of shards
  of the internal state table, typically set to match the number of
  parameter servers for large data sets.
}
```

In the training program you will just have to run the returned Op from
minimize().

```python
# Execute opt_op and train for num_steps.
for _ in range(num_steps):
  opt_op.run()

# You can also check for convergence by calling
lr.approximate_duality_gap()
```

## Methods

<h3 id="__init__"><code>__init__</code></h3>

``` python
__init__(
    examples,
    variables,
    options
)
```

Create a new sdca optimizer.

<h3 id="approximate_duality_gap"><code>approximate_duality_gap</code></h3>

``` python
approximate_duality_gap()
```

Add operations to compute the approximate duality gap.

#### Returns:

An Operation that computes the approximate duality gap over all
examples.

<h3 id="minimize"><code>minimize</code></h3>

``` python
minimize(
    global_step=None,
    name=None
)
```

Add operations to train a linear model by minimizing the loss function.

#### Args:

* <b>`global_step`</b>: Optional `Variable` to increment by one after the
    variables have been updated.
* <b>`name`</b>: Optional name for the returned operation.


#### Returns:

An Operation that updates the variables passed in the constructor.

<h3 id="predictions"><code>predictions</code></h3>

``` python
predictions(examples)
```

Add operations to compute predictions by the model.

If logistic_loss is being used, predicted probabilities are returned.
Otherwise, (raw) linear predictions (w*x) are returned.

#### Args:

* <b>`examples`</b>: Examples to compute predictions on.


#### Returns:

An Operation that computes the predictions for examples.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if examples are not well defined.

<h3 id="regularized_loss"><code>regularized_loss</code></h3>

``` python
regularized_loss(examples)
```

Add operations to compute the loss with regularization loss included.

#### Args:

* <b>`examples`</b>: Examples to compute loss on.


#### Returns:

An Operation that computes mean (regularized) loss for given set of
examples.

#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if examples are not well defined.

<h3 id="unregularized_loss"><code>unregularized_loss</code></h3>

``` python
unregularized_loss(examples)
```

Add operations to compute the loss (without the regularization loss).

#### Args:

* <b>`examples`</b>: Examples to compute unregularized loss on.


#### Returns:

An Operation that computes mean (unregularized) loss for given set of
examples.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if examples are not well defined.

<h3 id="update_weights"><code>update_weights</code></h3>

``` python
update_weights(train_op)
```

Updates the model weights.

This function must be called on at least one worker after `minimize`.
In distributed training this call can be omitted on non-chief workers to
speed up training.

#### Args:

* <b>`train_op`</b>: The operation returned by the `minimize` call.


#### Returns:

An Operation that updates the model weights.
