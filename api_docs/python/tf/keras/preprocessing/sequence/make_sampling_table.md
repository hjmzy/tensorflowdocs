# tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.make_sampling_table

``` python
make_sampling_table(
    size,
    sampling_factor=1e-05
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/keras/_impl/keras/preprocessing/sequence.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/keras/_impl/keras/preprocessing/sequence.py).

Generates a word rank-based probabilistic sampling table.

This generates an array where the ith element
is the probability that a word of rank i would be sampled,
according to the sampling distribution used in word2vec.

The word2vec formula is:
    p(word) = min(1, sqrt(word.frequency/sampling_factor) /
    (word.frequency/sampling_factor))

We assume that the word frequencies follow Zipf's law (s=1) to derive
a numerical approximation of frequency(rank):
   frequency(rank) ~ 1/(rank * (log(rank) + gamma) + 1/2 - 1/(12*rank))
    where gamma is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

#### Arguments:

* <b>`size`</b>: int, number of possible words to sample.
* <b>`sampling_factor`</b>: the sampling factor in the word2vec formula.


#### Returns:

A 1D Numpy array of length `size` where the ith entry
is the probability that a word of rank i should be sampled.
