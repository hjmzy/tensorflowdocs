# tf.contrib.losses.metric_learning.npairs_loss

``` python
npairs_loss(
    labels,
    embeddings_anchor,
    embeddings_positive,
    reg_lambda=0.002,
    print_losses=False
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/losses/python/metric_learning/metric_loss_ops.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/losses/python/metric_learning/metric_loss_ops.py).

Computes the npairs loss.

Npairs loss expects paired data where a pair is composed of samples from the
same labels and each pairs in the minibatch have different labels. The loss
has two components. The first component is the L2 regularizer on the
embedding vectors. The second component is the sum of cross entropy loss
which takes each row of the pair-wise similarity matrix as logits and
the remapped one-hot labels as labels.

#### Args:

* <b>`labels`</b>: 1-D tf.int32 `Tensor` of shape [batch_size/2].
* <b>`embeddings_anchor`</b>: 2-D Tensor of shape [batch_size/2, embedding_dim] for the
    embedding vectors for the anchor images. Embeddings should not be
    l2 normalized.
* <b>`embeddings_positive`</b>: 2-D Tensor of shape [batch_size/2, embedding_dim] for the
    embedding vectors for the positive images. Embeddings should not be
    l2 normalized.
* <b>`reg_lambda`</b>: Float. L2 regularization term on the embedding vectors.
* <b>`print_losses`</b>: Boolean. Option to print the xent and l2loss.


#### Returns:

* <b>`npairs_loss`</b>: tf.float32 scalar.
