# tf.contrib.quantize.create_training_graph

``` python
create_training_graph(
    input_graph,
    elements=None
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/quantize/python/quantize_graph.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/quantize/python/quantize_graph.py).

Returns a transformed training input_graph for simulated quantization.

The forward pass has fake quantization ops inserted to simulate the error
introduced by quantization.

#### Args:

* <b>`input_graph`</b>: The tf.Graph to be transformed.
* <b>`elements`</b>: (Optional) List of Tensors and Operations in input_graph whose
      corresponding elements in the new graph will be returned.


#### Returns:

Returns a tuple(g, l) where:
g is new tf.Graph that is rewritten for simulated quantization.
l is a list of Tensors/Operations in g corresponding to the provided input
    elements.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If elements contains an element that isn't a tf.Tensor or
      tf.Operation.
