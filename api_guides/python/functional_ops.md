<h2 id="Higher_Order_Operators">Higher Order Operators</h2>

TensorFlow provides several higher order operators to simplify the common
map-reduce programming patterns.

*   [`tf.map_fn`](../../api_docs/python/tf/map_fn.md)
*   [`tf.foldl`](../../api_docs/python/tf/foldl.md)
*   [`tf.foldr`](../../api_docs/python/tf/foldr.md)
*   [`tf.scan`](../../api_docs/python/tf/scan.md)
