# tf.losses.softmax_cross_entropy

``` python
softmax_cross_entropy(
    onehot_labels,
    logits,
    weights=1.0,
    label_smoothing=0,
    scope=None,
    loss_collection=tf.GraphKeys.LOSSES,
    reduction=Reduction.SUM_BY_NONZERO_WEIGHTS
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/ops/losses/losses_impl.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/ops/losses/losses_impl.py).

Creates a cross-entropy loss using tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits.

`weights` acts as a coefficient for the loss. If a scalar is provided,
then the loss is simply scaled by the given value. If `weights` is a
tensor of shape `[batch_size]`, then the loss weights apply to each
corresponding sample.

If `label_smoothing` is nonzero, smooth the labels towards 1/num_classes:
    new_onehot_labels = onehot_labels * (1 - label_smoothing)
                        + label_smoothing / num_classes

#### Args:

* <b>`onehot_labels`</b>: `[batch_size, num_classes]` target one-hot-encoded labels.
* <b>`logits`</b>: [batch_size, num_classes] logits outputs of the network .
* <b>`weights`</b>: Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or rank 1 and is
    broadcastable to the loss which is a `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size]`.
* <b>`label_smoothing`</b>: If greater than 0 then smooth the labels.
* <b>`scope`</b>: the scope for the operations performed in computing the loss.
* <b>`loss_collection`</b>: collection to which the loss will be added.
* <b>`reduction`</b>: Type of reduction to apply to loss.


#### Returns:

Weighted loss `Tensor` of the same type as `logits`. If `reduction` is
`NONE`, this has shape `[batch_size]`; otherwise, it is scalar.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If the shape of `logits` doesn't match that of `onehot_labels`
    or if the shape of `weights` is invalid or if `weights` is None.  Also if
    `onehot_labels` or `logits` is None.
