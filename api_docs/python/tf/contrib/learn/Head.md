# tf.contrib.learn.Head

## Class `Head`





Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/head.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/head.py).

Interface for the head/top of a model.

Given logits (or output of a hidden layer), a Head knows how to compute
predictions, loss, default metric and export signature. It is meant to,

1) Simplify writing model_fn and to make model_fn more configurable
2) Support wide range of machine learning models. Since most heads can work
    with logits, they can support DNN, RNN, Wide, Wide&Deep,
    Global objectives, Gradient boosted trees and many other types
    of machine learning models.
2) To allow users to seamlessly switch between 1 to n heads for multi
objective learning (See _MultiHead implementation for more details)

Common usage:
Here is simplified model_fn to build a multiclass DNN model.
  ```python
  def _my_dnn_model_fn(features, labels, mode, params, config=None):
    # Optionally your callers can pass head to model_fn as a param.
    head = tf.contrib.learn.multi_class_head(...)
    input = tf.contrib.layers.input_from_feature_columns(features, ...)
    last_hidden_layer_out = tf.contrib.layers.stack(
        input, tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected, [1000, 500])
    logits = tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected(
        last_hidden_layer_out, head.logits_dimension, activation_fn=None)

    def _train_op_fn(loss):
      return optimizer.minimize(loss)

    return head.create_model_fn_ops(
        features=features,
        labels=labels,
        mode=mode,
        train_op_fn=_train_op_fn,
        logits=logits,
        scope=...)
  ```

Most heads also support logits_input which is typically the output of the last
hidden layer. Some heads (like heads responsible for candidate sampling or
hierarchical softmax) intrinsically will not support logits and you have
to pass logits_input. Here is a common usage,
  ```python
  return head.create_model_fn_ops(
      features=features,
      labels=labels,
      mode=mode,
      train_op_fn=_train_op_fn,
      logits_input=last_hidden_layer_out,
      scope=...)
  ```python

There are cases where computing and applying gradients can not be meaningfully
captured with train_op_fn we support (for example, with sync optimizer). In
such case, you can take the responsibility on your own. Here is a common
use case,
  ```python
  model_fn_ops = head.create_model_fn_ops(
      features=features,
      labels=labels,
      mode=mode,
      train_op_fn=tf.contrib.learn.no_op_train_fn,
      logits=logits,
      scope=...)
  if mode == tf.contrib.learn.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
    optimizer = ...
    sync = tf.train.SyncReplicasOptimizer(opt=optimizer, ...)
    update_op = tf.contrib.layers.optimize_loss(optimizer=sync,
                                                loss=model_fn_ops.loss, ...)
    hooks = [sync.make_session_run_hook(is_chief)]
    ... upate train_op and hooks in ModelFnOps and return
  ```

## Properties

<h3 id="logits_dimension"><code>logits_dimension</code></h3>

Size of the last dimension of the logits `Tensor`.

Typically, logits is of shape `[batch_size, logits_dimension]`.

#### Returns:

The expected size of the `logits` tensor.



## Methods

<h3 id="create_model_fn_ops"><code>create_model_fn_ops</code></h3>

``` python
create_model_fn_ops(
    features,
    mode,
    labels=None,
    train_op_fn=None,
    logits=None,
    logits_input=None,
    scope=None
)
```

Returns `ModelFnOps` that a model_fn can return.

Please note that,
+ Exactly one of `logits` and `logits_input` must be provided.
+ All args must be passed via name.

#### Args:

* <b>`features`</b>: Input `dict` of `Tensor` objects.
* <b>`mode`</b>: Estimator's `ModeKeys`.
* <b>`labels`</b>: Labels `Tensor`, or `dict` of same.
* <b>`train_op_fn`</b>: Function that takes a scalar loss `Tensor` and returns an op
      to optimize the model with the loss. This is used in TRAIN mode and
      must not be None. None is allowed in other modes. If you want to
      optimize loss yourself you can pass `no_op_train_fn` and then use
      ModeFnOps.loss to compute and apply gradients.
* <b>`logits`</b>: logits `Tensor` to be used by the head.
* <b>`logits_input`</b>: `Tensor` from which to build logits, often needed when you
    don't want to compute the logits. Typically this is the activation of
    the last hidden layer in a DNN. Some heads (like the ones responsible
    for candidate sampling) intrinsically avoid computing full logits and
    only accepts logits_input.
* <b>`scope`</b>: Optional scope for `variable_scope`.


#### Returns:

An instance of `ModelFnOps`.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `mode` is not recognized.
* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If neither or both of `logits` and `logits_input` is provided.
