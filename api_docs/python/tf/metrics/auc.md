Defined in [`tensorflow/python/ops/metrics_impl.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/ops/metrics_impl.py).

Computes the approximate AUC via a Riemann sum.

The `auc` function creates four local variables, `true_positives`,
`true_negatives`, `false_positives` and `false_negatives` that are used to
compute the AUC. To discretize the AUC curve, a linearly spaced set of
thresholds is used to compute pairs of recall and precision values. The area
under the ROC-curve is therefore computed using the height of the recall
values by the false positive rate, while the area under the PR-curve is the
computed using the height of the precision values by the recall.

This value is ultimately returned as `auc`, an idempotent operation that
computes the area under a discretized curve of precision versus recall values
(computed using the aforementioned variables). The `num_thresholds` variable
controls the degree of discretization with larger numbers of thresholds more
closely approximating the true AUC. The quality of the approximation may vary
dramatically depending on `num_thresholds`.

For best results, `predictions` should be distributed approximately uniformly
in the range [0, 1] and not peaked around 0 or 1. The quality of the AUC
approximation may be poor if this is not the case. Setting `summation_method`
to 'minoring' or 'majoring' can help quantify the error in the approximation
by providing lower or upper bound estimate of the AUC.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `auc`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

#### Args:

* <b>`labels`</b>: A `Tensor` whose shape matches `predictions`. Will be cast to
    `bool`.
* <b>`predictions`</b>: A floating point `Tensor` of arbitrary shape and whose values
    are in the range `[0, 1]`.
* <b>`weights`</b>: Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as
    `labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must
    be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `labels` dimension).
* <b>`num_thresholds`</b>: The number of thresholds to use when discretizing the roc
    curve.
* <b>`metrics_collections`</b>: An optional list of collections that `auc` should be
    added to.
* <b>`updates_collections`</b>: An optional list of collections that `update_op` should
    be added to.
* <b>`curve`</b>: Specifies the name of the curve to be computed, 'ROC' [default] or
    'PR' for the Precision-Recall-curve.
* <b>`name`</b>: An optional variable_scope name.
* <b>`summation_method`</b>: Specifies the Riemann summation method used, 'trapezoidal'
    [default] that applies the trapezoidal rule, 'minoring' that applies
    left summation for increasing intervals and right summation for decreasing
    intervals or 'majoring' that applies the opposite.


#### Returns:

* <b>`auc`</b>: A scalar `Tensor` representing the current area-under-curve.
* <b>`update_op`</b>: An operation that increments the `true_positives`,
    `true_negatives`, `false_positives` and `false_negatives` variables
    appropriately and whose value matches `auc`.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `predictions` and `labels` have mismatched shapes, or if
    `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `predictions`, or if
    either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or
    tuple.
