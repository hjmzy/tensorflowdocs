Defined in [`tensorflow/python/ops/embedding_ops.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/ops/embedding_ops.py).

See the guide: [Neural Network > Embeddings](../../../../api_guides/python/nn.md#Embeddings)

Looks up `ids` in a list of embedding tensors.

This function is used to perform parallel lookups on the list of
tensors in `params`.  It is a generalization of
[`tf.gather`](../../tf/gather.md), where `params` is
interpreted as a partitioning of a large embedding tensor.  `params` may be
a `PartitionedVariable` as returned by using `tf.get_variable()` with a
partitioner.

If `len(params) > 1`, each element `id` of `ids` is partitioned between
the elements of `params` according to the `partition_strategy`.
In all strategies, if the id space does not evenly divide the number of
partitions, each of the first `(max_id + 1) % len(params)` partitions will
be assigned one more id.

If `partition_strategy` is `"mod"`, we assign each id to partition
`p = id % len(params)`. For instance,
13 ids are split across 5 partitions as:
`[[0, 5, 10], [1, 6, 11], [2, 7, 12], [3, 8], [4, 9]]`

If `partition_strategy` is `"div"`, we assign ids to partitions in a
contiguous manner. In this case, 13 ids are split across 5 partitions as:
`[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]`

The results of the lookup are concatenated into a dense
tensor. The returned tensor has shape `shape(ids) + shape(params)[1:]`.

#### Args:

* <b>`params`</b>: A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor,
    or a list of P tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension,
    representing sharded embedding tensors.  Alternatively, a
    `PartitionedVariable`, created by partitioning along dimension 0. Each
    element must be appropriately sized for the given `partition_strategy`.
* <b>`ids`</b>: A `Tensor` with type `int32` or `int64` containing the ids to be looked
    up in `params`.
* <b>`partition_strategy`</b>: A string specifying the partitioning strategy, relevant
    if `len(params) > 1`. Currently `"div"` and `"mod"` are supported. Default
    is `"mod"`.
* <b>`name`</b>: A name for the operation (optional).
* <b>`validate_indices`</b>: DEPRECATED. If this operation is assigned to CPU, values
    in `indices` are always validated to be within range.  If assigned to GPU,
    out-of-bound indices result in safe but unspecified behavior, which may
    include raising an error.
* <b>`max_norm`</b>: If provided, embedding values are l2-normalized to the value of
    max_norm.


#### Returns:

A `Tensor` with the same type as the tensors in `params`.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `params` is empty.
