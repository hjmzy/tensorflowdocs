# tf.contrib.seq2seq.monotonic_attention

``` python
monotonic_attention(
    p_choose_i,
    previous_attention,
    mode
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/python/ops/attention_wrapper.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/python/ops/attention_wrapper.py).

Compute monotonic attention distribution from choosing probabilities.

Monotonic attention implies that the input sequence is processed in an
explicitly left-to-right manner when generating the output sequence.  In
addition, once an input sequence element is attended to at a given output
timestep, elements occurring before it cannot be attended to at subsequent
output timesteps.  This function generates attention distributions according
to these assumptions.  For more information, see ``Online and Linear-Time
Attention by Enforcing Monotonic Alignments''.

#### Args:

* <b>`p_choose_i`</b>: Probability of choosing input sequence/memory element i.  Should
    be of shape (batch_size, input_sequence_length), and should all be in the
    range [0, 1].
* <b>`previous_attention`</b>: The attention distribution from the previous output
    timestep.  Should be of shape (batch_size, input_sequence_length).  For
    the first output timestep, preevious_attention[n] should be [1, 0, 0, ...,
    0] for all n in [0, ... batch_size - 1].
* <b>`mode`</b>: How to compute the attention distribution.  Must be one of
    'recursive', 'parallel', or 'hard'.
      * 'recursive' uses tf.scan to recursively compute the distribution.
        This is slowest but is exact, general, and does not suffer from
        numerical instabilities.
      * 'parallel' uses parallelized cumulative-sum and cumulative-product
        operations to compute a closed-form solution to the recurrence
        relation defining the attention distribution.  This makes it more
        efficient than 'recursive', but it requires numerical checks which
        make the distribution non-exact.  This can be a problem in particular
        when input_sequence_length is long and/or p_choose_i has entries very
        close to 0 or 1.
      * 'hard' requires that the probabilities in p_choose_i are all either 0
        or 1, and subsequently uses a more efficient and exact solution.


#### Returns:

A tensor of shape (batch_size, input_sequence_length) representing the
attention distributions for each sequence in the batch.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: mode is not one of 'recursive', 'parallel', 'hard'.
