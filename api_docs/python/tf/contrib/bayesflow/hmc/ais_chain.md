ais_chain(
    n_iterations,
    step_size,
    n_leapfrog_steps,

Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/bayesflow/python/ops/hmc_impl.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/bayesflow/python/ops/hmc_impl.py).

Runs annealed importance sampling (AIS) to estimate normalizing constants.

This routine uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to sample from a series of
distributions that slowly interpolates between an initial "proposal"
distribution

`exp(proposal_log_prob_fn(x) - proposal_log_normalizer)`

and the target distribution

`exp(target_log_prob_fn(x) - target_log_normalizer)`,

accumulating importance weights along the way. The product of these
importance weights gives an unbiased estimate of the ratio of the
normalizing constants of the initial distribution and the target
distribution:

E[exp(w)] = exp(target_log_normalizer - proposal_log_normalizer).

#### Args:

* <b>`n_iterations`</b>: Integer number of Markov chain updates to run. More
    iterations means more expense, but smoother annealing between q
    and p, which in turn means exponentially lower variance for the
    normalizing constant estimator.
* <b>`step_size`</b>: Scalar step size or array of step sizes for the
    leapfrog integrator. Broadcasts to the shape of
    `initial_x`. Larger step sizes lead to faster progress, but
    too-large step sizes make rejection exponentially more likely.
    When possible, it's often helpful to match per-variable step
    sizes to the standard deviations of the target distribution in
    each variable.
* <b>`n_leapfrog_steps`</b>: Integer number of steps to run the leapfrog
    integrator for. Total progress per HMC step is roughly
    proportional to step_size * n_leapfrog_steps.
* <b>`initial_x`</b>: Tensor of initial state(s) of the Markov chain(s). Must
    be a sample from q, or results will be incorrect.
* <b>`target_log_prob_fn`</b>: Python callable which takes an argument like `initial_x`
    and returns its (possibly unnormalized) log-density under the target
    distribution.
* <b>`proposal_log_prob_fn`</b>: Python callable that returns the log density of the
    initial distribution.
* <b>`event_dims`</b>: List of dimensions that should not be treated as
    independent. This allows for multiple chains to be run independently
    in parallel. Default is (), i.e., all dimensions are independent.
* <b>`name`</b>: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this function.


#### Returns:

* <b>`ais_weights`</b>: Tensor with the estimated weight(s). Has shape matching
    `target_log_prob_fn(initial_x)`.
* <b>`chain_states`</b>: Tensor with the state(s) of the Markov chain(s) the final
    iteration. Has shape matching `initial_x`.
* <b>`acceptance_probs`</b>: Tensor with the acceptance probabilities for the final
    iteration. Has shape matching `target_log_prob_fn(initial_x)`.

#### Examples:

```python
# Estimating the normalizing constant of a log-gamma distribution:
def proposal_log_prob(x):
  # Standard normal log-probability. This is properly normalized.
  return tf.reduce_sum(-0.5 * tf.square(x) - 0.5 * np.log(2 * np.pi), 1)
def target_log_prob(x):
  # Unnormalized log-gamma(2, 3) distribution.
  # True normalizer is (lgamma(2) - 2 * log(3)) * x.shape[1]
  return tf.reduce_sum(2. * x - 3. * tf.exp(x), 1)
# Run 100 AIS chains in parallel
initial_x = tf.random_normal([100, 20])
w, _, _ = hmc.ais_chain(1000, 0.2, 2, initial_x, target_log_prob,
                        proposal_log_prob, event_dims=[1])
log_normalizer_estimate = tf.reduce_logsumexp(w) - np.log(100)
```

```python
# Estimating the marginal likelihood of a Bayesian regression model:
base_measure = -0.5 * np.log(2 * np.pi)
def proposal_log_prob(x):
  # Standard normal log-probability. This is properly normalized.
  return tf.reduce_sum(-0.5 * tf.square(x) + base_measure, 1)
def regression_log_joint(beta, x, y):
  # This function returns a vector whose ith element is log p(beta[i], y | x).
  # Each row of beta corresponds to the state of an independent Markov chain.
  log_prior = tf.reduce_sum(-0.5 * tf.square(beta) + base_measure, 1)
  means = tf.matmul(beta, x, transpose_b=True)
  log_likelihood = tf.reduce_sum(-0.5 * tf.square(y - means) +
                                 base_measure, 1)
  return log_prior + log_likelihood

  return regression_log_joint(beta, x, y)
# Run 100 AIS chains in parallel
initial_beta = tf.random_normal([100, x.shape[1]])

                                   log_joint_partial, proposal_log_prob,
