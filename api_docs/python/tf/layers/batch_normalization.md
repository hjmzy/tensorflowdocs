"Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing
Internal Covariate Shift"

Sergey Ioffe, Christian Szegedy

Note: when training, the moving_mean and moving_variance need to be updated.
By default the update ops are placed in `tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS`, so they
need to be added as a dependency to the `train_op`. For example:

```python
  update_ops = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS)
  with tf.control_dependencies(update_ops):
    train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)
```

#### Arguments:

* <b>`inputs`</b>: Tensor input.
* <b>`axis`</b>: An `int`, the axis that should be normalized (typically the features
    axis). For instance, after a `Convolution2D` layer with
    `data_format="channels_first"`, set `axis=1` in `BatchNormalization`.
* <b>`momentum`</b>: Momentum for the moving average.
* <b>`epsilon`</b>: Small float added to variance to avoid dividing by zero.
* <b>`center`</b>: If True, add offset of `beta` to normalized tensor. If False, `beta`
    is ignored.
* <b>`scale`</b>: If True, multiply by `gamma`. If False, `gamma` is
    not used. When the next layer is linear (also e.g. `nn.relu`), this can be
    disabled since the scaling can be done by the next layer.
* <b>`beta_initializer`</b>: Initializer for the beta weight.
* <b>`gamma_initializer`</b>: Initializer for the gamma weight.
* <b>`moving_mean_initializer`</b>: Initializer for the moving mean.
* <b>`moving_variance_initializer`</b>: Initializer for the moving variance.
* <b>`beta_regularizer`</b>: Optional regularizer for the beta weight.
* <b>`gamma_regularizer`</b>: Optional regularizer for the gamma weight.
* <b>`beta_constraint`</b>: An optional projection function to be applied to the `beta`
      weight after being updated by an `Optimizer` (e.g. used to implement
      norm constraints or value constraints for layer weights). The function
      must take as input the unprojected variable and must return the
      projected variable (which must have the same shape). Constraints are
      not safe to use when doing asynchronous distributed training.
* <b>`gamma_constraint`</b>: An optional projection function to be applied to the
      `gamma` weight after being updated by an `Optimizer`.
* <b>`training`</b>: Either a Python boolean, or a TensorFlow boolean scalar tensor
    (e.g. a placeholder). Whether to return the output in training mode
    (normalized with statistics of the current batch) or in inference mode
    (normalized with moving statistics). **NOTE**: make sure to set this
    parameter correctly, or else your training/inference will not work
    properly.
* <b>`trainable`</b>: Boolean, if `True` also add variables to the graph collection
    `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES` (see tf.Variable).
* <b>`name`</b>: String, the name of the layer.
* <b>`reuse`</b>: Boolean, whether to reuse the weights of a previous layer
    by the same name.
* <b>`renorm`</b>: Whether to use Batch Renormalization
    (https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03275). This adds extra variables during
    training. The inference is the same for either value of this parameter.
* <b>`renorm_clipping`</b>: A dictionary that may map keys 'rmax', 'rmin', 'dmax' to
    scalar `Tensors` used to clip the renorm correction. The correction
    `(r, d)` is used as `corrected_value = normalized_value * r + d`, with
    `r` clipped to [rmin, rmax], and `d` to [-dmax, dmax]. Missing rmax, rmin,
    dmax are set to inf, 0, inf, respectively.
* <b>`renorm_momentum`</b>: Momentum used to update the moving means and standard
    deviations with renorm. Unlike `momentum`, this affects training
    and should be neither too small (which would add noise) nor too large
    (which would give stale estimates). Note that `momentum` is still applied
    to get the means and variances for inference.
* <b>`fused`</b>: if `True`, use a faster, fused implementation if possible.
    If `None`, use the system recommended implementation.
* <b>`virtual_batch_size`</b>: An `int`. By default, `virtual_batch_size` is `None`,
    which means batch normalization is performed across the whole batch. When
    `virtual_batch_size` is not `None`, instead perform "Ghost Batch
    Normalization", which creates virtual sub-batches which are each
    normalized separately (with shared gamma, beta, and moving statistics).
    Must divide the actual batch size during execution.


#### Returns:

Output tensor.
