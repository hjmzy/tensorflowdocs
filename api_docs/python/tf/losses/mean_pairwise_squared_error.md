# tf.losses.mean_pairwise_squared_error

``` python
mean_pairwise_squared_error(
    labels,
    predictions,
    weights=1.0,
    scope=None,
    loss_collection=tf.GraphKeys.LOSSES
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/ops/losses/losses_impl.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/ops/losses/losses_impl.py).

Adds a pairwise-errors-squared loss to the training procedure.

Unlike `mean_squared_error`, which is a measure of the differences between
corresponding elements of `predictions` and `labels`,
`mean_pairwise_squared_error` is a measure of the differences between pairs of
corresponding elements of `predictions` and `labels`.

For example, if `labels`=[a, b, c] and `predictions`=[x, y, z], there are
three pairs of differences are summed to compute the loss:
  loss = [ ((a-b) - (x-y)).^2 + ((a-c) - (x-z)).^2 + ((b-c) - (y-z)).^2 ] / 3

Note that since the inputs are of shape `[batch_size, d0, ... dN]`, the
corresponding pairs are computed within each batch sample but not across
samples within a batch. For example, if `predictions` represents a batch of
16 grayscale images of dimension [batch_size, 100, 200], then the set of pairs
is drawn from each image, but not across images.

`weights` acts as a coefficient for the loss. If a scalar is provided, then
the loss is simply scaled by the given value. If `weights` is a tensor of size
[batch_size], then the total loss for each sample of the batch is rescaled
by the corresponding element in the `weights` vector.

#### Args:

* <b>`labels`</b>: The ground truth output tensor, whose shape must match the shape of
    `predictions`.
* <b>`predictions`</b>: The predicted outputs, a tensor of size
    `[batch_size, d0, .. dN]` where N+1 is the total number of dimensions in
    `predictions`.
* <b>`weights`</b>: Coefficients for the loss a scalar, a tensor of shape
    `[batch_size]` or a tensor whose shape matches `predictions`.
* <b>`scope`</b>: The scope for the operations performed in computing the loss.
* <b>`loss_collection`</b>: collection to which the loss will be added.


#### Returns:

A scalar `Tensor` that returns the weighted loss.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If the shape of `predictions` doesn't match that of `labels` or
    if the shape of `weights` is invalid.  Also if `labels` or `predictions
    is None.
