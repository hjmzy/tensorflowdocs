# tf.contrib.layers.sparse_column_with_hash_bucket

``` python
sparse_column_with_hash_bucket(
    column_name,
    hash_bucket_size,
    combiner='sum',
    dtype=tf.string
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/layers/feature_column.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/layers/feature_column.py).

See the guide: [Layers (contrib) > Feature columns](../../../../../api_guides/python/contrib.layers.md#Feature_columns)

Creates a _SparseColumn with hashed bucket configuration.

Use this when your sparse features are in string or integer format, but you
don't have a vocab file that maps each value to an integer ID.
output_id = Hash(input_feature_string) % bucket_size

#### Args:

* <b>`column_name`</b>: A string defining sparse column name.
* <b>`hash_bucket_size`</b>: An int that is > 1. The number of buckets.
* <b>`combiner`</b>: A string specifying how to reduce if the sparse column is
    multivalent. Currently "mean", "sqrtn" and "sum" are supported, with "sum"
    the default. "sqrtn" often achieves good accuracy, in particular with
    bag-of-words columns.
      * "sum": do not normalize features in the column
      * "mean": do l1 normalization on features in the column
      * "sqrtn": do l2 normalization on features in the column
    For more information: `tf.embedding_lookup_sparse`.
* <b>`dtype`</b>: The type of features. Only string and integer types are supported.


#### Returns:

A _SparseColumn with hashed bucket configuration


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: hash_bucket_size is not greater than 2.
* <b>`ValueError`</b>: dtype is neither string nor integer.
