Defined in [`tensorflow/python/ops/parsing_ops.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/ops/parsing_ops.py).

Parses a single `SequenceExample` proto.

Parses a single serialized [`SequenceExample`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/example/example.proto)
proto given in `serialized`.

This op parses a serialized sequence example into a tuple of dictionaries
mapping keys to `Tensor` and `SparseTensor` objects respectively.
The first dictionary contains mappings for keys appearing in
`context_features`, and the second dictionary contains mappings for keys
appearing in `sequence_features`.

At least one of `context_features` and `sequence_features` must be provided
and non-empty.

The `context_features` keys are associated with a `SequenceExample` as a
whole, independent of time / frame.  In contrast, the `sequence_features` keys
provide a way to access variable-length data within the `FeatureList` section
of the `SequenceExample` proto.  While the shapes of `context_features` values
are fixed with respect to frame, the frame dimension (the first dimension)
of `sequence_features` values may vary between `SequenceExample` protos,
and even between `feature_list` keys within the same `SequenceExample`.

`context_features` contains `VarLenFeature` and `FixedLenFeature` objects.
Each `VarLenFeature` is mapped to a `SparseTensor`, and each `FixedLenFeature`
is mapped to a `Tensor`, of the specified type, shape, and default value.

`sequence_features` contains `VarLenFeature` and `FixedLenSequenceFeature`
objects. Each `VarLenFeature` is mapped to a `SparseTensor`, and each
`FixedLenSequenceFeature` is mapped to a `Tensor`, each of the specified type.
The shape will be `(T,) + df.dense_shape` for `FixedLenSequenceFeature` `df`, where
`T` is the length of the associated `FeatureList` in the `SequenceExample`.
For instance, `FixedLenSequenceFeature([])` yields a scalar 1-D `Tensor` of
static shape `[None]` and dynamic shape `[T]`, while
`FixedLenSequenceFeature([k])` (for `int k >= 1`) yields a 2-D matrix `Tensor`
of static shape `[None, k]` and dynamic shape `[T, k]`.

Each `SparseTensor` corresponding to `sequence_features` represents a ragged
vector.  Its indices are `[time, index]`, where `time` is the `FeatureList`
entry and `index` is the value's index in the list of values associated with
that time.

`FixedLenFeature` entries with a `default_value` and `FixedLenSequenceFeature`
entries with `allow_missing=True` are optional; otherwise, we will fail if
that `Feature` or `FeatureList` is missing from any example in `serialized`.

`example_name` may contain a descriptive name for the corresponding serialized
proto. This may be useful for debugging purposes, but it has no effect on the
output. If not `None`, `example_name` must be a scalar.

#### Args:

* <b>`serialized`</b>: A scalar (0-D Tensor) of type string, a single binary
    serialized `SequenceExample` proto.
* <b>`context_features`</b>: A `dict` mapping feature keys to `FixedLenFeature` or
    `VarLenFeature` values. These features are associated with a
    `SequenceExample` as a whole.
* <b>`sequence_features`</b>: A `dict` mapping feature keys to
    `FixedLenSequenceFeature` or `VarLenFeature` values. These features are
    associated with data within the `FeatureList` section of the
    `SequenceExample` proto.
* <b>`example_name`</b>: A scalar (0-D Tensor) of strings (optional), the name of
    the serialized proto.
* <b>`name`</b>: A name for this operation (optional).


#### Returns:

A tuple of two `dict`s, each mapping keys to `Tensor`s and `SparseTensor`s.
The first dict contains the context key/values.
The second dict contains the feature_list key/values.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if any feature is invalid.
