```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/util/deprecation.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/util/deprecation.py).

See the guide: [Framework (contrib) > Deprecation](../../../../../api_guides/python/contrib.framework.md#Deprecation)

Decorator for marking functions or methods deprecated.

This decorator logs a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is
called. It has the following format:

  <function> (from <module>) is deprecated and will be removed after <date>.
  Instructions for updating:
  <instructions>

If `date` is None, 'after <date>' is replaced with 'in a future version'.
<function> will include the class name if it is a method.

It also edits the docstring of the function: ' (deprecated)' is appended
to the first line of the docstring and a deprecation notice is prepended
to the rest of the docstring.

#### Args:

* <b>`date`</b>: String or None. The date the function is scheduled to be removed.
    Must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD), or None.
* <b>`instructions`</b>: String. Instructions on how to update code using the
    deprecated function.
* <b>`warn_once`</b>: Boolean. Set to `True` to warn only the first time the decorated
    function is called. Otherwise, every call will log a warning.


#### Returns:

Decorated function or method.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If date is not None or in ISO 8601 format, or instructions are
    empty.
